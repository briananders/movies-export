        <Plot>James Bond has one more mission. Bond returns from his travels in the USSR with a computer chip. This chip is capable of withstanding a nuclear electromagnetic pulse that would otherwise destroy a normal chip. The chip was created by Zorin Industries, and Bond heads off to investigate its owner, Max Zorin. Zorin may only seem like a innocent guilty man, but is really planning to set off an earthquake in San Andreas which will wipe out all of Silicon Valley. As well as Zorin, Bond must also tackle May Day and equally menacing companion of Zorin, whilst dragging Stacy Sutton along for the ride.&#x0A;&#x0A;A silicon chip is captured from the Soviets and found to be identical to a prototype British design capable of withstanding the intense electromagnetic radiation of a nuclear blast. The British suspect industrialist Max Zorin of leaking details of the design to the Russians. When James Bond is sent to investigate he finds that Zorin is stockpiling silicon chips and, mysteriously, drilling near the San Andreas fault.&#x0A;&#x0A;007 returns from the USSR with a new computer chip; one that is invulnerable to the magnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion. The chip is being manufactured by Zorin Industries, headed up by a sociopathic businessman named Max Zorin who is planning to corner the world microchip market by using explosives to cause an earthquake in the San Andreas fault that will wipe out Silicon Valley - and the millions who live and work there! Bond must face not only Zorin himself, but the equally twisted May Day and Scarpine, another one of Zorin&apos;s henchmen. Assisted by San Francisco City employee Stacy, Bond goes after the would-be computer magnate in a series of frightening confrontations - including fire in the SF City Hall, a wild chase through the city with Stacy at the wheel of a fire department ladder truck, and finally in a hand-to-hand fight atop San Francisco&apos;s Golden Gate Bridge.&#x0A;&#x0A;James Bond takes on one of his most maniacal villains to date, Max Zorin, a leading French Industrialist. Zorin plans to detonate a series of explosions in the Silicon Valley causing an earthquake so he can get his hands on the world&apos;s leading microchip market. It is up to 007 to stop him!&#x0A;&#x0A;When Bond is sent to investigate a security leak at the high-tech Zorin Industries, he discovers a hotbed of murder and deception. The company&apos;s mysterious owner, Max Zorin has devised a plan to corner the world microchip market, even if he has to kill millions to do it! But before Bond can stop Zorin, he must confront the madman&apos;s beautiful and deadly companion May Day. With help from the gorgeous Stacey, Bond will launch an all-out assault on Zorin&apos;s deadly scheme, climaxing in a spine-tingling duel on the upper spans of the Golden Gate Bridge.</Plot>

        <Plot>Pierce Brosnan leaps into action as Agent 007 in this spectacular thrill ride of death-defying stunts and amazing high-tech gadgets. In the most electrifying Bond film yet, the unstoppable action hero must prevent a tremendous disaster ripped from tomorrowÃ&quot;â??s headlines. Someone is pitting the worldÃ&quot;â??s superpowers against each other Ã&quot;â?&quot; and only James Bond can stop it. When a British warship is mysteriously destroyed in Chinese waters, the world teeters on the brink of WWIII Ã&quot;â?&quot; until 007 zeros in on the true criminal mastermind. BondÃ&quot;â??s do-or-die mission takes him to Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), a powerful industrialist who manipulates world events as easily as he changes headlines from his global media empire. After soliciting help from CarverÃ&quot;â??s sexy wife, Paris (Teri Hatcher), Bond joins forces with a stunning yet lethal Chinese agent, Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), in a series of explosive chases, brutal confrontations and breathtaking escapes as they race to stop the presses on CarverÃ&quot;â??s next planned news story: global pandemonium! With powerhouse action sequences, including a wild motorcycle pursuit through (and over!) Saigon, Tomorrow Never Dies is a thrilling action-adventure Ã&quot;â??that roars from start to finish with the throttle wide open (Gene Shalit, NBC-TV)!</Plot>

        <Plot>12 Angry Men, by Sidney Lumet, may be the most radical big-screen courtroom drama in cinema history. A behind-closed-doors look at the American legal system as riveting as it is spare, the iconic adaptation of Reginald RoseÃ¢ÂÂs teleplay stars Henry Fonda as the initially dissenting member of a jury of white men ready to pass judgment on a Puerto Rican teenager charged with murdering his father. What results is a saga of epic proportions that plays out in real time over ninety minutes in one sweltering room. LumetÃ¢ÂÂs electrifying snapshot of 1950s America on the verge of change is one of the great feature-film debuts. Ã¢ÂÂThe Criterion Collection</Plot>

        <Plot>New York police detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is on his way home when his lieutenant assigns him a simple task of escorting a petty criminal,Eddie Bunker (Mos Def),from lockup to the courthouse which is only 16 blocks away. Jack has been a police officer for over 20-years,and now he is over the hill with a bad leg and a drinking problem. All Jack wants is to get a bottle and go home. What Jack doesn&apos;t know is that Eddie made a deal with the District Attorney to testify against a fellow police officer at his station before a grand jury. A van with two hit men are following Jack as he leaves the station,and their job is to kill Eddie before he can testify. Jack prevents the assassination,and they escape the scene and run into a bar. Jack calls for backup,and his ex-partner Frank Nugent (David Morse) and his team are the first to arrive at the bar. Unfortunately for Eddie,one member of the team is the cop Eddie is about to testify against. Jack must choose between his fellow cops or protecting the life of a criminal.

        <Plot>Popular high school senior Mike O&apos;Donnell (Zac Efron) seemingly has it all. He is a star athlete headed straight for a college scholarship when he decides to give it up to settle down with his high school girlfriend Scarlet is pregnant.&#x0A;Twenty years later,an adult Mike (played by Matthew Perry) finds his life is not exactly what he expected. He is separated from his wife,Scarlett (Leslie Mann) and living with his wealthy software genius nerd and best friend Ned Freedman (Thomas Lennon),his career at a pharmaceutical company is at a stand still,and his relationships with his teenage children are nonexistent. After getting passed up for yet another promotion at work,he returns to his high school to reminisce over his basketball awards and the life he could have had. While he is reliving his glory days,he is approached by a janitor and shares with him how things were so much better when he was 17.&#x0A;As Mike is driving home from the high school,he sees the mysterious janitor standing on the ledge preparing to jump into the Los Angeles River. Mike rushes out of his car to rescue him,but when he gets there,the janitor has vanished. What Mike doesn&apos;t realize is that he is about to fall into the river and turn into his 17 year old self.&#x0A;Young Mike (Zac Efron) returns to Ned&apos;s house,where he has the difficult task of convincing Ned that he is in fact Mike. At a loss of what to do,Ned pretends to be Mike&apos;s father and they register Mike back in high school to finish the life he never had the chance to live.&#x0A;High school presents a lot of new challenges for Mike,such as dressing cool,keeping up with the latest gadgets and making new friends. But nothing compares to being in high school with his own children. He discovers that his daughter,Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg),is not nearly as innocent as he thought she was and his son,Alex (Sterling Knight),is the brunt of the star athlete&apos;s jokes.&#x0A;But Mike&apos;s most difficult realization is that he hasn&apos;t been a very good father or husband. Mike befriends Alex and tries to instill him with enough confidence to join the basketball team. He gets close to Maggie&apos;s obnoxious boyfriend and does everything in his power to break them up. Most importantly,he visits an unsuspecting Scarlet and rediscovers all the things that initially made him fall in love with her. You don&apos;t know what you have until you lose it.&#x0A;Through his experiences,Mike realizes that he had chosen the perfect life he just never appreciated it. Now,he must figure out a way to transform back into his older self and win back his wife and kids. *Info from comingsoon.net*---------------------In 1989,Michael O&apos;Donnell was the star of the high-school basketball team,with a college scout in the bleachers ready to watch his championship game and a scholarship guaranteed for him if he played well. Just as the game is about to start,he sees his girlfriend Scarlett by the bleachers. He blows her a kiss,then goes to her when she looks very troubled. She tries to pretend everything is fine,but finally she tells him she&apos;s pregnant. The game starts,but he can&apos;t think of anything but Scarlett,and when he sees her leaving,he tosses the ball away and walks away from the game and the scholarship to marry her.Twenty years later,Mike&apos;s life is a mess. Scarlett has separated from him,forcing him to move in with his high-school best friend Ned Gold,now a geeky millionaire software developer,and his kids Maggie and Alex are distant and want nothing to do with him. At his job,his boss passes him up for a promotion in favor of a woman the boss likes who&apos;s far less competent,and Mike explodes at the boss and is fired. He stops by his old high school on the way home,sees his 1989 team photo in the showcase,and reminisces about the life he threw away. Then he encounters a mysterious janitor who asks him if he really wishes he was a teenager back in high school again,and he does. On the way home,he sees the &quot;janitor&quot; apparently ready to jump from a bridge and he tries to stop him,but the janitor suddenly disappears and Mike falls in the river himself,where he&apos;s magically transformed back to age17.After he convinces Ned who he really is,Mike decides he&apos;s been given the chance to live his life over again &quot;but to do it right&quot; -- to win the basketball scholarship and go to college. With Ned posing as his father,he re-enrolls in high school under the name &quot;Mark Gold,&quot; living with Ned in his mansion full of high-tech toys. But as he starts to fit in to school life,he realizes his daughter is dating the sadistic basketball captain Stan,who only wants sex from her,and that Stan is also bullying and tormenting his son. Gradually,&quot;Mark&quot; realizes that the real reason he&apos;s been given another chance in life is to help his children and try to win back Scarlett&apos;s love. He befriends Alex and discovers that his son has real talent in basketball and can hit 3-point shots effortlessly. He works with Alex to sharpen the rest of his game so he can win a place on the team and the girl of his dreams. As Alex and Mark practice shooting baskets together every day at Alex&apos;s house,Scarlett is amazed how much her son&apos;s new friend looks like her ex-husband looked in 1989.Mark starts helping Scarlett landscape her back yard,because she hopes to start a landscaping business. He gains a new appreciation for her talents,but he frequently comes close to her or touches her in ways she considers inappropriate between an adult woman and a teenaged boy. He also comforts Maggie when Stan dumps her for refusing to &quot;put out.&quot; He tells her that someday she&apos;ll find a guy who treasures her the way she deserves,but he&apos;s horrified when he realizes Maggie is starting to think that guy is HIM. He tells her he can&apos;t get involved with her because he&apos;s already in love with someone else,someone secret.The basketball team wins a come-from-behind game,with Mark doing a lot,but Alex makes the winning 3-point shot. Meanwhile,Ned has been smitten with Jane,the high school principal,since the first day he went to her office to enroll his &quot;son,&quot; but his geeky attempts to impress her have done nothing but disgust her. Finally,in return for buying laptops for all the students in the school,she agrees to go to dinner with him on the same night that Mark has announced a party at his house to celebrate winning the game. Mark tells only certain people about the party,but kids text it everywhere and the whole school shows up.Ned&apos;s romantic dinner with Jane is going nowhere until he finally admits that he&apos;s always been a loser with women. He&apos;s really just a geek,obsessed with The Lord of the Rings. She slowly smiles,and starts talking to him in Elvish -- one of the languages in The Lord of the Rings -- and he realizes that she&apos;s also a Lord of the Rings fanatic. After a seductive conversation in Elvish,Ned and Jane go back to his house for romance,but they find Mark&apos;s party completely out of control with hundreds of kids everywhere. Scarlett is also there,looking for Alex,and Mark&apos;s feelings for her are so strong that he can&apos;t control himself and he tries to kiss her in front of all the kids. Scarlett is appalled and slaps him,then runs away with Mark following her,shouting that he&apos;s her husband and the father of her children. Maggie and her friends all see this and are disgusted,especially Maggie,because Mark had told her he was in love with someone secret,and now she sees him trying to kiss her own mother.The next morning,cleaning up the chaos after the party,Ned reminds Mark that the hearing for Mike O&apos;Donnell&apos;s final divorce decree with Scarlett is in 20 minutes,and they rush to the courtroom. Ned pretends to be Mike&apos;s lawyer,and they&apos;re being thrown out when Mark says he&apos;s there to read a letter that Mike has written to his wife. Scarlett agrees to hear the letter,and Mark reads it with emotional power in his voice that astonishes her,plus details about their courtship that only her husband could have known. Mark finishes by saying that,since he sees that she doesn&apos;t want him in her life anymore,he&apos;s content to let her go because he loves her so much. After Mark finishes and is forced to leave the courtroom,Scarlett picks up the &quot;letter&quot; and discovers it&apos;s just a piece of paper with directions to the courthouse on it. Mark wasn&apos;t reading a letter at all but somehow knew all the things he had told her. She asks for the divorce decree to be postponed.Mark tries to forget about Scarlett and concentrates on basketball,because winning the scholarship and going to college seem to be the only thing he has left for him. On the day of the championship game,where Mark and Alex are playing and Maggie is cheerleading,Scarlett is looking at her high-school yearbook and realizes that Mark doesn&apos;t just look similar to her husband at 17,he looks EXACTLY the same. Then Maggie reminds Scarlett she&apos;s supposed to drive her to the game,and Scarlett stays to watch.As the game is about to start,Mark sees Scarlett in the bleachers. He blows her a kiss,using a gesture identical to the one Mike had used in 1989,when he was playing in the same championship game and saw her standing by the bleachers. Scarlett finally realizes that Mark really IS her husband,somehow turned 17 again. She realizes all the reasons she loved him then and still loves him,but she knows she can&apos;t possibly make her life together with a 17 year-old boy. Also,she realizes that knowing she&apos;s there in the bleachers watching him could put him in the same situation as before,and she can&apos;t risk making him lose his college scholarship again. She leaves,going down the same corridor she used when she left the game in 1989.Mark sees Scarlett leaving,forgets about the game and walks away,just as he did in 1989. He hands the ball to Alex,saying this time it&apos;s his turn,and runs down the corridor after Scarlett. We see the mysterious janitor smiling in the stands,and by the time Mark catches up to Scarlett,he&apos;s the adult Mike O&apos;Donnell again. Mike tells Scarlett he&apos;s made a mess of his marriage because he spent the last 20 years resentful at her for losing him his chance to go to college,but now he realizes his family is the only thing that matters to him,and he asks for another chance.A few days later,Mike goes to Ned&apos;s house to get his stuff and return his key. He finds Ned in bed with Jane,both of them wearing Elf ears. Mike thanks Ned for all he&apos;s done,and Ned gives Mike a parting gift,a whistle for his new job,because Jane has made Mike the new coach of the high school basketball team.</Plot>

        <Plot>MIT student Ben Campbell,played by English actor Jim Sturgess,is accepted into Harvard Medical School,but he cannot afford the $300,000 tuition. He is interviewed as a potential candidate for the prestigious Robinson Scholarship,which will pay for all his school-related expenses. Despite boasting stats such as a 1590 SAT score,44 MCAT score,and a 4.0 GPA at MIT,Campbell is told that competition for the scholarship is fierce. Ben is urged to write an essay that will make him stand out,an essay that will dazzle the recruiter and make Campbell&apos;s personality and abilities jump off the page.During an advanced math class,Prof. Micky Rosa,played by Kevin Spacey,challenges Campbell with the Monty Hall problem,which Campbell solves successfully. Prof. Rosa invites Campbell to join his blackjack team led by Rosa,which consists of young men Choi and Fisher,and women Jill Taylor,played by Kate Bosworth,and Kianna. The system involves card counting,and the team is split into two groups: The &quot;spotters&quot;,who play the minimum bet,keeping track of the count,and sending secret signals; and the &quot;big players&quot;,who place large bets whenever the count at a table is favorable. Campbell is reluctant to join at first,but eventually relents,with the caveat that he will stay on the team only long enough to pay for his tuition. After weeks of intensive training,Campbell is given a final live test at an underground casino. He passes the test and is assigned to be a big player.Prof. Rosa (sometimes referred to as &quot;Micky&quot;) takes the team to Las Vegas where Campbell begins to realize the joys of a new lifestyle. Campbell&apos;s performance impresses Rosa,but eventually provokes jealousy in teammate Fisher. One evening,a drunken Fisher sits at Ben&apos;s table and starts talking about the &quot;retard&quot; in Rain Man,who won by counting cards. He then incites a melee when he spills a drink on another player at the table. Mr. Rosa kicks Fisher off the team and sends him home. All the while,security chief Cole Williams,played by Laurence Fishburne has been monitoring the blackjack team,especially Campbell. Campbell,meanwhile,falls for Jill,culminating in the pair sleeping together in Las Vegas.Back at MIT,Campbell,because he is distracted by the blackjack,botches his part of a university project with his friends for the 2.0.9 competition. His friends angrily tell him that they will do the project themselves,with Campbell feeling that the project is not important anymore. On his next trip to Las Vegas,Campbell is emotionally distracted and continues playing even after he is signaled to walk away. An angry Micky Rosa storms out on the group,promising that Campbell will reimburse him for the $200,000 loss. Campbell and his three remaining teammates bankroll the rest of their money and agree to go into business for themselves. Micky,believed to have gone back to Boston,instead stays and rats out the M.I.T. team to casino security Cole Williams,who finds and apprehends Campbell and takes him to a secluded basement,where he beats him. Coleman releases Campbell with a threat and a dire warning.Campbell returns to MIT only to find a letter telling him that he received an incomplete for one of his classes and therefore won&apos;t graduate. At the same time,he discovers that his winnings have been stolen from his dorm room. Campbell suspects that Micky Rosa is behind everything,but cannot prove it,so he makes Rosa an offer: Campbell and the team will hit Las Vegas for one final big score before the casino installs biometric software,as long as Rosa joins the team. Mr. Rosa agrees.Dressed up in disguise,the team returns to Planet Hollywood&apos;s Vegas casino. They rake in over $640,000 before security chief Williams,along with a security team,finds them and gives chase. The team members quickly bag their chips and then flee through the casino. Ben has the bag of chips which he reluctantly gives over to Mickey as they decide to split up and meet later at the Foxx Strip Club. As the rest of the team is still being chased inside the casino,Mickey dives into a waiting limo and yells &quot;airport&quot; to the driver. It is obvious Mickey has no plans on going to the Foxx Strip Club. As he smiles with glee and dives into the bag of chips,he discovers the chips are actually hotel chocolates that are shaped just like casino chips. This is in part a reference to an earlier scene in the movie during which Choi shows his tendency to steal things by compulsively stealing a large number of hotel chocolates (the fake chips) from an unattended maid cart.As the movie backtracks,we learn that Campbell and the rest of the team the whole time had a plan not only to make themselves a great deal of money but also to deliver Micky Rosa to Cole Williams. Early in the chase in the casino,Campbell and Jill get separated from Micky briefly,during which time Jill hands Ben the bag of chocolates as he hands her the bag of real casino chips,which she puts in her pocketbook. We also learn that security chief Cole Williams and Prof. Micky Rosa actually have a long history of playing cat and mouse in Las Vegas together. One night,while Cole was at his father&apos;s funeral,his casino got taken for seven figures. This event led to the firing of Cole and thus the grudge he holds against Micky.It is revealed that Williams made a deal with Campbell: Williams would let Campbell come to Las Vegas for one last night to make a lot of money in exchange for Rosa. However,Williams,gun in hand,confronts Campbell on his way out and demands the bag of chips. Back in the casino,Williams informs Rosa that he also has a friend who is &quot;good with numbers,but he works for the IRS.&quot;The movie is told in the narrative voice-over POV of Ben Campbell. When Jill and Ben return to the casino,they not only meet the rest of the team,they also meet his two best friends from Boston with whom he had entered the 2.0.9. competition. Campbell says of them,&quot;they were pretty good at basic math too.&quot; Campbell&apos;s summation is that getting his friends back,having really good life experiences,and hooking up with &quot;the prettiest girl in school,&quot; were all worth much much more than all the money they had made counting cards. The movie closes with Campbell recounting the tale to the scholarship administrator,who looks back at him,&quot;dazzled&quot;.</Plot>

        <Plot>FLASHBACK: The movie begins as Montgomery &quot;Monty&quot; Brogan (Edward Norton) is driving in NYC with Kostya (Tony Siraguza),his Russian/Ukranian mobster-type muscle. Kostya has a heavy accent and some trouble with English idioms. He references &quot;Doyle&apos;s Law&quot; rather than Murphy&apos;s Law. They&apos;re late to meet with some &quot;important people.&quot; They find a badly injured dog that was obviously abandoned after a dogfight,and Monty wants to first shoot the dog with Kostya&apos;s gun (as a mercy killing) and then when he sees what a scrapper the pup is,he decides to save the dog. He grabs it in his jacket,and sticks it in his trunk,and though the dog bites him,he&apos;s very impressed with that fighting spirit. They drive on.PRESENT: Monty is sitting at the pier with the dog,whom he named Doyle. It&apos;s early morning; people are jogging. A strung out junkie comes to Monty begging for a fix,and Monty tells him to go to Harlem,because he&apos;s been &quot;touched&quot; and is out of the business. The junkie just doesn&apos;t seem to get it,says he&apos;s been coming to Monty for 5 years and that he&apos;ll remember this! He lurches off,and Monty wanders away with Doyle.Monty and Doyle walk along the streets of NYC,and end up on the campus of what looks like a private prep school. Monty stands looking at a display of sports trophies and old photos,til a school administrator confronts him and tells him to leave with the dog. He tells her that he used to go to this school,and was on the basketball team,was doing well til he was kicked out of the school for fighting. She thaws a little bit as he shows her himself in the photo and says he held some big record. She tells him that record was broken just last year,and she knows because she coaches the girls&apos; team. He&apos;s a little taken aback/wistful. He asks if she could help him find Jake Elinsky,his friend.In a classroom,Jakob &quot;Jake&quot; Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is teaching his poetry class. The chairs are all arranged in a circle and Mary (Anna Paquin) who is dressed very provocatively,and has a giant henna tattoo on her stomach,is reading a poem out loud.The rest of the class seems like they&apos;re completely dead/disinterested. Just then,Monty shows up at the door and briefly talks to Jake. He tells him to get in touch with Frank and that they can&apos;t meet for dinner because he has to go see his dad. That they should meet afterwards at a bar and then there&apos;s a &quot;going away&quot; party for him that night at the Bridge club. He notes that Mary is hot and that she&apos;s giving him the eye. He leaves and the bell rings; the students all scatter.Then I&apos;m not quite sure I remember the exact order that this all happens in the next section,but basically all these things happen.* We see a busy stock/bond exchange type room. Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Xavier Slattery (Barry Pepper) gets the call from Jake. He can&apos;t talk though,and hangs up. Frank&apos;s boss comes and yells at him that he needs to sell off some stocks/bonds. It&apos;s obvious that Frank has a very high pressure job and deals with a lot of money,but is on top of it all. He doesn&apos;t do what the boss asks and fights with some underlings. It looks like he was right not to sell the bonds,however.* Back at the school,Mary comes to see Jake in the teacher&apos;s lounge. He asks about her henna tattoo and she implies that her mother doesn&apos;t really care what she does. Mary argues about the unfair B- grade that he gave her on her last assignment,saying she needs better grades to get into college. She&apos;s pissed he gave another student an A+ for a story about his dead grandmother,but the night before the funeral,that guy was getting drunk at a basketball party and slapping girls&apos; asses. Jake says that it&apos;s sometimes difficult for guys to show emotion,and refuses to give Mary a better grade. She storms out.* Monty and Doyle go home. Out on the stoop,Naturelle (Rosario Dawson),Monty&apos;s girlfriend,is waiting for him.She&apos;s been sitting there all day,worried when he was already gone when she woke up. He says he needed to get out. It&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s a lot of tension between them. She wants to know if they&apos;re going to spend any time together or what. He tells her about the party being thrown tonight for him by Uncle Nikolai,and she really doesn&apos;t want him to go,but he says he can hardly avoid it. She then has him open a jar of honey,and she eats it straight out of the jar with a spoon,which he calls disgusting,but then they kiss. She wants him to take a bath with her,and he refuses,saying maybe later.Then there&apos;s a FLASHBACK -- they&apos;re in the bath together,joking around about having kids and Monty teasing Nat for getting a tattoo of the Puerto Rican flag when she&apos;s lived her whole life in NYC.Someone&apos;s at the door,and Nat thinks it&apos;s her mom. But when she opens the door,it&apos;s the DEA! The DEA agents are really pretty nasty. They treat both Monty and Nat rudely,and it&apos;s obvious they know where the drugs are hidden. One of the agents opens up the couch cushions,taking out a bunch of money and drugs. Monty&apos;s fucked.Flash to the present,and Monty&apos;s sitting on the couch. Naturelle keeps bugging him about spending time together,and he tells her that she needs to be quiet. That he has to go see his dad and that he&apos;ll see her at the club later. He asks her to wear the silver dress,because that&apos;s how he wants to remember her. Then he gets dressed and takes off,leaving Doyle at home.Outside,Kostya is waiting at the stoop and reminds Monty about the party being held tonight by Uncle Nikolai in his honor. Monty&apos;s wondering why people keep insisting he go to the party. He says he&apos;ll be there with Naturelle and some friends. Kostya says he shouldn&apos;t bring Naturelle,and implies that she&apos;s the one who ratted him out. Evidently,that is what everyone believes. Monty goes off to have dinner with his dad.We next see Monty inside Brogan&apos;s,an Irish pub owned by his dad,James Brogan (Brian Cox). It&apos;s basically a fireman&apos;s hangout that has taken quite a hit in terms of business since 9/11.During their conversation,we discover that Monty&apos;s dad used to be a fireman and an alcoholic. His mom died when Monty was only 11,and James blames himself for how things have turned out. &quot;You could have been anything! A lawyer,a doctor!&quot; It also comes out that James evidently owed money to some guy named &quot;Sal&quot; and Monty&apos;s been paying it off. &quot;Where did you think that money came from? You didn&apos;t have any problems taking it,&quot; says Monty,and goes to take a leak.There&apos;s a really powerful scene in the bathroom as Monty looks in the mirror and sees that it&apos;s got &quot;Fuck You&quot; written on it. Monty begins to rant about just about everyone in New York,the blacks,the Koreans,the Jews,the Russians,the Italians,the Irish,etc. as a montage shows clips of various ethnicities and places in NYWC. He curses out his friends Frank and Jake,he curses out Naturelle,and in the end,he says,&quot;Fuck you,Montgomery Brogan,you had it all and you threw it all away.&quot; His rage is palpable. He tries to wipe the &quot;Fuck You&quot; off the mirror,but it&apos;s painted on.He returns to the table and asks his dad if he trusts Nat. He says it&apos;s been weird and he&apos;s not sure,maybe she&apos;s the one that fingered him. He says he only really trusts his dad and Frank and Jake,his two oldest friends. He leaves to go meet Frank and Jake,and his dad says he&apos;ll come in the morning to drive him to the jail.* There&apos;s another FLASHBACK to when Monty was taken in by the DEA. Naturelle gets let go and the DEA agents also imply that she was the one that fingered him. They threaten Monty with a 15-life sentence,explaining that the Rockefeller Laws in the state of NY make possession of that much drugs a major felony,and if he doesn&apos;t cooperate... They basically try to get him to sell out Uncle Nikolai,but he refuses and talks smack so it seems like they&apos;re going to throw the book at him.* In the meantime,Jake has come over to Frank&apos;s apartment,which overlooks Ground Zero. The two men talk as they look down at the horrifying sight. Frank says that he has no intention of moving. The two men then discuss Monty. Jake seems to think that after Monty gets out,they&apos;ll still be friends,but Frank tells him that it&apos;s going to be over. That Monty&apos;s not really going to survive prison and they&apos;ll never see him again. That Monty was a drug dealer and this is his fault that it ended up like this. We find out that when he was kicked out of the private school as a teenager (he was there on scholarship) it wasn&apos;t for fighting,but for selling weed to the other kids. Jake wonders what will happen to Doyle and wishes that Monty could take his beloved dog into jail with him.The two men then go over to a Chinese restaurant,where we find out more about the two. Frank tells Jake that Jake&apos;s in the 62nd percentile of all NY bachelors,while he,Frank,is in the 99 percentile. Criteria include the money he makes,whereas Jake (it turns out) has a trust fund and is ashamed of being a wealthy Jewish kid. Frank tells Jake that he also has chronic bad breath. Jake is really hurt by Frank&apos;s comments and points out that Frank has no table manners at all and he dyes his hair. As for Monty,he&apos;s in the 0 percentile. He&apos;s going to jail.* At some point,there&apos;s another FLASHBACK where we learn how Monty met Naturelle. She&apos;s a high school student loitering in a playground where Monty meets up with a man in a suit (I&apos;m pretty sure that it&apos;s the same guy as the strung out junkie in the beginning of the film),who gives him a number to call. Monty,however,borrows Nat&apos;s lighter to burn the number. They start chatting and he asks if she&apos;s 18,which she says he is. She&apos;s also on the basketball team and they flirt a lot.* Now we cut to a bar where Frank and Jake are waiting for Monty and still talking about the percentile thing,which the cute female bartender is aware of. Haltingly,Jake starts telling Frank about his &quot;friend&quot; the teacher who has the hots for a student. Frank,naturally,sees through this,and gives Jake a hard time,saying he better not have fucked her. That he should wait til she&apos;s out of school. Then Naturelle shows up,looking the bomb in a silver latex dress. They joke around a little,with Frank asking why it is that girls always cry after really great sex. Nat goes to the bathroom,and Monty shows up. The bartender chick serves them free drinks and invites them all to her birthday party that weekend; there&apos;s a horrible,awkward moment. They drink and then they all take off to the club where the &quot;going-away&quot; party is being held.* There&apos;s a huge line to get into the club,but naturally they can get in through the back like VIPs. The bouncer out front gives Monty some tips about going to jail and to keep his head down. A really hot DJ is spinning tonight,some 17 yo kid named Dusk. As the gang heads toward the back entrance,Mary spies Jake and runs up to him. She wants to get into the club with her friends and Jake pretends to be into Dusk while she says she thought he&apos;d be more into Barry Manilow. Monty has Mary go in,but not her friends.Inside the club,champagne is served and Mary drinks it right down. She and Naturelle go and dance,while Frank goes upstairs for some special whiskey. Jake and Monty share a quiet moment,where Jake tries to make a toast and fumbles. Monty says,let&apos;s drink to Doyle. He says that the best thing that ever happened to him was saving Doyle and that Jake should have him now,because Nat&apos;s going to live with her mom,and Doyle hates Frank. Jake is happy,but really worried that somehow it&apos;ll get out that he brought Mary into the club.Frank comes back and then Kostya shows up. Kostya says it&apos;s time to go see Uncle Nikolai and he,Monty,and Frank start going upstairs. Monty asks for 5 minutes alone with Frank. He tells Frank that he had all these thoughts of going straight and investing the money with Frank&apos;s help,but he got greedy. Frank basically tells him the opposite of the stuff he had said to Jake -- that Monty&apos;s a fighter,that he&apos;s going to be OK,that when he gets out,he&apos;ll be there for him and they can start an Irish bar together. That he&apos;s known Monty since age 3 and never once broken a promise to him. Monty says that is all true,but tomorrow is when he&apos;s really going to be in trouble -- when he goes to the jail and the pretty boy that he is,gets reamed out (literally) by all the other convicts. He says he has a plan that might buy him some time and he makes Frank promise to help. We don&apos;t see find out what it is,as it cuts away.In the meantime,Mary comes back to see that Jake&apos;s basically asleep at the table. Mary&apos;s totally drunk and &quot;had some E earlier.&quot; She&apos;s having a really good time,she really likes Nat,she starts to bump and grind against Jake. He asks her to keep all this quiet,she hints that he should raise her grade. Then she basically asks where&apos;s the bathroom,and goes up there (it&apos;s a very obvious come-on). Despite his better judgement,Jake goes up there and kisses her. It&apos;s a weird,awkward moment. She seems stunned. He leaves the bathroom without another word.Meanwhile,Nat is at another bar with Frank. She asks him to look out for Monty tonight,make sure he doesn&apos;t hurt himself (which is an underlying theme -- they think he might kill himself to avoid going to jail). Frank&apos;s drinking shot after shot of whiskey and he and Nat get into a fight. Basically,he accuses Nat of ratting out Monty and blames himself for not stopping him on his downward spiral. Up until this moment,it seemed like Frank may have been actually the one to rat him out,but it because obvious that he loves Monty and didn&apos;t. He tells Nat that she hasn&apos;t worked an honest day in her life and that he never took any of the money. &quot;Seven years from now,I&apos;ll be at the gate waiting for him,and you&apos;ll be married to money.&quot; She storms off. Jake comes and tells Frank he kissed Mary. Frank tells him to shut up and have another drink; that they can&apos;t leave yet because they have to be there for Monty.Monty and Kostya in the meantime are shown into a room where Uncle Nikolai is sitting. Kostya&apos;s gun is taken by the other thugs and it&apos;s a really tense scene. Uncle Nikolai is a Russian mobster who tells Monty about his first time in prison -- he was 14 years old,just a little boy. But he came out a man. He tells him that Monty should find someone who&apos;s not being protected and beat the shit out of him,and that way seem like he&apos;s a little crazy,but still respectful of the right people. Then Nikolai and the henchment basically threaten Monty with his father&apos;s life. They know everything about his dad and imply that they could &quot;take care&quot; of James -- either way,either by helping him out,or by snuffing him out. Monty begs them to leave his dad out of it,he says he wants out. He wants nothing to do with it anymore. He says he knows that they pinched him to get to Nikolai but that he didn&apos;t rat him out,he swears.There&apos;s a tense,tense moment where Nikolai points the gun at Monty. But then he says that he knows that Monty didn&apos;t say anything. But someone fingered Monty -- who was it? Only two people knew where he kept the drugs and money. Naturelle and Kostya!!! Kostya admits it was him! He says he &quot;had no choice&quot; as Monty basically holds the gun to his head. But Monty tells Nikolai to &quot;do his own dirty work&quot; and leaves without killing Kostya. Nikolai reminds Monty to &quot;survive&quot; and as the door closes,the other Russian mobsters are beating the shit out of Kostya and about to kill him.Monty,Frank,and Jake leave the club to go home and get Doyle. Monty asks if they don&apos;t mind staying out a little later to do something. Monty goes into the bedroom,where Naturelle is sleeping. He tells her he&apos;s sorry how it&apos;s been; that he knows it wasn&apos;t her. She says she loves him. He says he&apos;ll come back. He,and Frank,and Jake all go out walking by the river with Doyle. It&apos;s sort of like the scene earlier in the movie.Then they go into the park and Monty calls in his favor to Frank. He wants Frank to &quot;make him ugly&quot; so that maybe he won&apos;t get shafted on his first day of prison. Frank won&apos;t do it. They all start screaming at one another,and Monty tells Frank he knows he&apos;s wanted to slap some sense into him. Eventually,Jake gets in the middle,and Monty punches him. Then Frank starts to beat the shit out of him,and crying. It&apos;s a really powerful,visceral scene. Jake is able to get Monty back to his feet and he lurches back to home,where Naturelle is absolutely horrified to see him in this state. She tries to get him cleaned up and wants him to go to the hospital,but he refuses.We see Frank sitting in the same spot by the river that Monty was earlier. Jake&apos;s walking with Doyle and gets some attention from a girl because of it.Monty&apos;s dad shows up to take him to jail,and Monty reluctantly agrees to go. He tells Nat she should forget about him and live her life,though she swears she&apos;ll wait for him. She gives him ice for the horrifying injuries on his face,but he dumps it all out on his way down and gets into the car with his dad.As they drive up the turnpike,his dad offers to just keep driving. &quot;You&apos;ll lose your bar!&quot; &quot;What do you think matters to me more? The bar or my only son?&quot; Over a montage of scenes of them driving out west,James tells Monty of how he can find some town out there in the desert,disappear,make a new life for himself. He&apos;ll never see him again,but he&apos;ll know his boy&apos;s ok. Eventually,maybe,Monty can be reunited with Naturelle,and they can have kids and someday,he can tell the kids about his earlier life and how close it came that this blissful life &quot;almost didn&apos;t happen.&quot; We see this playing out -- them driving through the desert,them drinking a final shot of whiskey together,Monty getting a new ID,a new job,reunited with Nat,the kids,and everything.And as the &quot;almost didn&apos;t happen&quot; is said in the voiceover,we cut back to the car and see that they&apos;re still driving up the turnpike towards the jail,as Monty doses in a stupor.</Plot>

        <Plot>Spartan customs are harsh. The Spartans inspect each infant born to ensure it is whole - if it is deformed,the baby is abandoned to die. They raise their boys in the school of hard knocks - in combat training,a small boy&apos;s loss of his weapon earns a bloody lip from the hand of his own father. At age 7,each young boy is torn from his mother and makes his own way in the wilderness,to return a man. Even the King endures this rite of passage. At age 15,young King-to-be Leonidas (Tyler Neitzel) lures a wolf into a narrow passage so that he can kill it. He returns home to be crowned King.Years later,messengers visit King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) requesting Sparta&apos;s submission to King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Insulted by their attitude,King Leonidas kicks the messengers into a well. Acknowledging the threat of Xerxes&apos;s invasion force,he visits the Ephors (priests) to obtain their favour before sending the Spartan army in battle. He proposes to repel the numerically superior enemy by using the terrain of the Hot Gates of Thermopylae,funneling the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The Ephors,wary of the plan,consult the Oracle (Kelly Craig). In her drugged trance she decrees that Sparta must not go to war,lest they interrupt the sacred Carneian festival. Leonidas departs in anger,and the priests receive their bribe of Xerxes&apos; gold from the Spartan traitor,Theron (Dominic West),for their negative response.Leonidas is reluctant to defy the corrupt clergy outright,but his wife (Lena Headey) encourages him to think outside the box. Leonidas elects to take 300 of his best soldiers as his &quot;bodyguard&quot; on a leisurely walk to the strategic Hot Gates location. His wife says goodbye,telling him to come back with his shield or on it,and gives him a necklace.On the road they meet some allies,who are shocked that the Spartans are sending such a small force. Leonidas asks the professions of the allied army,who are craftsmen and artisans. He points out that he has brought more soldiers than they. Joined by Arcadians and other Greeks,they arrive at the Hot Gates of Thermopylae. In sight of the approaching Persian army,they construct a wall to contain the Persians&apos; advance. Strong storms destroy some of Xerxes fleet,but it is only a small percentage of the massive army they will face.A horribly disfigured man,Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan),comes to see Leonidas to warn him of the goat path at the rear of his position. Ephialtes claims that his parents fled Sparta at his birth to save his life. He hopes to redeem them by fighting for Leonidas. Leonidas explains that each Spartan warrior is a key part of the phalanx,and asks Ephialtes to show that he can lift his shield high enough to properly defend his fellow warriors. When it becomes evident that he cannot,Leonidas gently tells him to care for the fallen instead. Ephialtes&apos; fondest hopes are crushed.A Persian emissary arrives,and finds that the bodies of the previous scouting party now make up part of the large rock wall. The Persian states that their arrows will blot out the sun,and the Spartans agree they will simply fight in the shade. The emissary&apos;s party is killed.Prior to the battle the Persians demand that the Spartans drop their arms and surrender. Leonidas refuses and challenges the Persians to come and take their weapons from them. With their tightly-knit phalanx formation,the Spartans funnel the Persians into the narrow terrain,repeatedly rebuffing them and inflicting heavy casualties.Xerxes,impressed with Spartan fighting skill,personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender. He promises Leonidas wealth and power in exchange for his loyalty. Leonidas declines,promising instead to make the &quot;God King&quot; bleed,and turns to rejoin his army.Dismayed at the refusal,Xerxes sends his masked personal guard,&quot;The Immortals&quot;,which name the Spartans also prove false. The battles continue,with the Spartans prevailing over soldiers and animals drawn from the vast reaches of the Persian empire: from Mongolian barbarians and Eastern chemists to African rhinoceroses and Indian war elephants. However,some of the brave Spartan warriors are killed,and it becomes clear that more will follow.Ephialtes goes to Xerxes,and agrees to show the goat path to the Persians in exchange for a uniform,along with promises of women and wealth.Back in Sparta,Queen Gorgo has been trying to convince the council to send help to Leonidas. A friendly councilman arranges for her to speak,but explains that she will need Theron on her side. Theron agrees to help her if she will sleep with him - so she does.At the Hot Gates,the Spartans learn they have been betrayed,and know their fight is doomed. The Arcadians retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow. Leonidas orders a reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell of their inevitable deaths.In Sparta,Queen Gorgo makes her appeal to the council. Instead of supporting her as promised,Theron betrays her,accusing her of adultery. Enraged,Gorgo snatches a sword and stabs Theron,rupturing a bag of gold in the folds of his robe. As the coins stamped with Persian markings spill onto the ground,the Council realizes Theron&apos;s treachery and agree to unite against Persia.At the Hot Gates,as the Persians surround the Spartans,Xerxes&apos;s general demands their surrender,declaring that Leonidas may keep his title as King of Sparta and become Warlord of all Greece,answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes urges this as well,to which Leonidas remarks,&quot;May you live forever,&quot; an insult from a culture valuing death and valor in battle. Leonidas drops his shield and removes his helmet,seemingly bowing in submission. Stelios then leaps over him and kills the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. As Persian archers shoot the remaining Spartans,Leonidas rises and hurls his spear at Xerxes,ripping open his cheek,thus making &quot;the God-King bleed.&quot; Xerxes,visibly shaken by this reminder of his own mortality,watches as the remaining Spartans perish beneath the combined might of his army. Leonidas himself marks his final moments by telling his wife aloud that he loves her. A rain of arrows falls upon him and the screen goes black. Back in Sparta,Dilios gives the necklace to Queen Gorgo and tells her of her husband&apos;s fate.Concluding his tale before an audience of attentive Spartans,Dilios declares that the 120,000-strong Persian army that narrowly defeated 300 Spartans now faces 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000 Greeks. Praising Leonidas&apos;s sacrifice,Dilios leads the assembled Greek army into a fierce charge against the Persian army,igniting the Battle of Plataea.</Plot>

        <Plot>A History of Violence start out in front of a quiet,rural motel in what looks like midwest farmland. A couple of men,Leland Jones and William &apos;Billy&apos; Orser (Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk) leave the room and make small talk while one goes in to &quot;check out&quot;. At this point,the only strange thing is that these two men look like unlikely traveling partners. Leland is over fifty,while Orser is in his twenties. Perhaps they are a couple? Apparently not,because when Leland comes out of the office,he calmly asks Orser to fill up the water bottle they are carrying in the car. When Orser goes into the office to do this,we see the motel clerk and housekeeper dead on the floor in a pool of blood. We see just how cold blooded these two murderers are when Orser shoots the motel clerk&apos;s young daughter who appears from behind a door looking scared.Meanwhile,we meet Tom Stall,a friendly diner owner,his attractive wife Edie,an attorney,and their children. Tom and Edie are very deeply in love and dote on their children. Everybody in the diner appears to be your stereotypical friendly,salt of the earth,small town types. The only unpleasant character we see in the entire town is Bobby,an insecure bully at the local high school who is aching to start a fight with Tom&apos;s son,Jack. While Jack is no wimp,he clearly doesn&apos;t have the heart for violence and declines to succumb to Bobby&apos;s taunts.That night,Bobby and his buddy are driving around,obviously bored,when they spot Jack and his girlfriend,Judy Danvers (Sumela Kay) sitting on a corner smoking a joint. As they begin to drive over,presumably to taunt the couple,they almost collide with a pickup truck. Bobby gives the finger to the passengers but quickly backs down when he sees the looks on their faces. These are Leland and Orser who glare at the two high schoolers with a look that implies &quot;you&apos;re about to make a big mistake.&quot; The killers then go to the diner while Orser rants about how he is &quot;sick of these damn podunk towns and the damn podunks in them.&quot; Although the diner is closing,the killers calmly walk up to the counter,sit down and politely ask for coffee. When told that the cafe is closing,Leland demands coffee in a much less polite fashion. Tom,always diplomatic,agrees. When the waitress,Charlotte (Deborah Drakeford) is about to leave at the end of her shift,Orser grabs her,forces her into a chair and orders her not to move.. Tom tries to resolve the situation by offering all the cash in the register,Leland pulls his gun and says he knows the money is his,then tells his partner to kill Charlotte in order to show Tom that they mean business. Seeing that the men intend to kill everyone in the diner,Tom smashes a pot of hot coffee into Leland&apos;s face,leaps over the counter and grabs Leland&apos;s gun,while Orser fires a shot that misses. Tom fires back,and Orser is hit and falls through the door&apos;s window. Thinking the situation is under control,Tom forgets about Leland,who,while lying on the floor,pulls a hidden knife and jams it into Tom&apos;s foot. Letting out a shriek,Tom shoots Leland through the head,turning his jaw into a mangled,bloody mess.When the media,who treat Tom as a hero,want to interview him,he declines and goes to the hospital. Fortunately,the injury is relatively minor and merely causes him to limp for a few days. A day later,Tom is back working at the cafe when three well dressed men,who are obviously not local,enter the crowded cafe and sit at the counter. The leader,who wears a suit and dark sun glasses,proceeds to ask for a cup of coffee and calls Tom &quot;Joey.&quot; He then proceeds to emphasize the name &quot;Joey&quot; several more times before Tom finally corrects him. Clearly,this man feels he knows Tom,and just as clearly,these men are trouble. When Tom&apos;s wife,Edie,gets annoyed at their comments,the leader hands Tom a hundred dollar bill and says,&quot;Now we&apos;re paying customers.&quot; When Edie threatens to call the police,the men leave.Next,the men are driving down a rural road when a patrol car pulls them over. Although the Sheriff,Sam Carney (Peter MacNeill),is seasoned and looks like he means business,the three men,especially the leader,appear not the least bit fazed by his implied threats. &quot;We&apos;re tourists&quot; and &quot;Keep up the good work,officer,&quot; are the leader&apos;s replies.Sam visits Tom and Edie to speak to them about the incident. Sam warns them that these men are mob figures... organized crime from the east coast. He called some contacts in Philadelphia and couldn&apos;t get any information on Joey Cusack (the name they called Tom)... but there is a Richie Cusack in Philly... the leader of a crime family.However,these men have just begun to stalk Tom and his family. After Tom sees their car going in the direction of his house,he limps back to his house and,huffing and puffing,runs in and grabs his shotgun only to find that nobody is coming. Later,the leader of the men,Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris),begins talking to Edie in a mall. Edie defends Tom,and Fogarty simply suggests that she ask Tom about Richie,who Fogarty says is Tom&apos;s brother... and to ask Tom,&quot;How come... he&apos;s so good... at killing people.&quot;Meanwhile,the same day,Tom&apos;s son,Jack,gets confronted by Bobby again and is unable to walk away. Enraged at the continued taunts,Jack suddenly proceeds to seriously beat down Bobby and his buddy,putting Bobby in the hospital. We now see that Tom and his son can be capable of serious damage if they are pushed far enough. Tom and Jack argue over the incident after Jack returns home,and Jack makes a snide remark over Tom&apos;s shooting the killers. Tom slaps Jack,who runs out of the house. When Tom sees the men&apos;s car pull up to his house,he is surprised to see one of the men step out of the car holding Jack. The leader,Mr. Fogarty,makes it clear that he knows who Tom really is and that Tom has no choice but to get into the car and drive back to Philadelphia to &quot;see some people.&quot; Tom agrees,and the men let Jack run into the house. When the men tell Tom to get in the car,Tom suggests that &quot;it would be better if you just leave.&quot; When one of the men points a gun at him,Edie watches in horror from the house as Tom proceeds to grab the man&apos;s arm,break it,smash the man&apos;s nose repeatedly with his palm,and shoot the other man dead. Before Tom can finish,Fogarty shoots Tom in the shoulder and asks Tom if he has anything to say before he kills him. Tom glares at Fogarty and replies: &quot;I should have killed you back in Philly.&quot; Fogarty smiles and agrees with Tom. But before he can shoot Tom,he gets a load of buckshot in the back,courtesy of Jack,who had come back outside and retrieved the shotgun. Tom proceeds to look at his son with a glare that further suggests that Tom may have lived a different life &quot;back in Philadelphia.&quot; He grabs the gun away from Jack,but then suddenly hugs him in gratitude and to comfort him,as Jack begins to cry.Edie confronts Tom In the hospital,tearfully begging him to tell the truth. Tom admits that he was in fact a teenage mob hit man named Joey Cusack,but he left the mob life many years ago after messing with Fogarty (who we later learn is a &apos;made man&apos; above any type of harm from any crime family) and became a new man,Tom Stall. Although Edie is naturally horrified and angry at the revelation,she later defends Tom when Sam comes to ask more questions about Fogarty,saying that these mob figures are extremely secretive men and wouldn&apos;t come so far into the open unless they were sure he has the right man. Edie defends Tom still,and Sam acquiesces and leaves,though he wiggles a finger in a way that shows he knows they&apos;re hiding something.. After Sam leaves,Edie turns away from Tom in revulsion,slapping him and shouting,&quot;Fuck you,Joey!&quot; Tom/Joey pushes her down onto the staircase and they engage in a pretty intense sex scene that contrasts with their more playful/romantic lovemaking in an earlier scene.Later,in bed,Tom is awakened by a phone call from Richie (William Hurt) himself. Richie makes an implied threat when he says,&quot;Are you gonna come see me,or do I have to come see you?&quot; Tom drives to Philadelphia and meets a young,rough looking guy in a bar. The man drives him to a large mansion where Tom meets a well dressed,confident man who appears very happy to see his &quot;little brother.&quot;After some small talk about Tom&apos;s new life,Richie begins telling Tom about all the trouble caused by &quot;Joey&apos;s&quot; former actions. Tom,who no longer wants any part of the mob life,asks Richie,&quot;Tell me what I have to do to make things right?&quot; Richie calmly replies,&quot;You could die,Joey,&quot; and turns around,so as not to watch the driver as he wraps a twine garrote around Tom&apos;s throat and tries to strangle him. Unfortunately for this man,he doesn&apos;t know just how dangerous an adversary Joey can be and Tom/Joey blocks the garrote with his hand,uses his foot to push backward off of Richie&apos;s desk and proceeds to kill the driver and two other hit men with his bare hands. Thinking that Joey has run out the door,Richie goes out to find him and is surprised when Joey gets the jump on him and shoots Richie in the head. Finally,Tom/Joey drives back home and finds his family starting to eat dinner. Looking exhausted,he sits at the table. His daughter Sarah sets a place for him as Edie lowers her head and appears to be praying. Finally she looks back up at Tom,tears starting to run down her face. Tom looks back at her with a grieved expression. Tom and Edie look at each other in a way that shows that their relationship has changed and will need considerable mending... but there is hope for them to still have a future together.</Plot>

        <Plot>The movie begins with our hero Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) rescuing a dog from an angry man,all but destroying his car in the process. The dog&apos;s owner,an attractive young woman,seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective&apos;s fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium,a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins&apos; mascot- a trained dolphin named snowflake. Next morning,the Dolphin&apos;s Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this &quot;pet detective&quot; in to try investigating.Meanwhile,Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of $25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate,Ace goes to the stadium &amp; takes a look inside Snowflake&apos;s tank,finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank &amp; is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake&apos;s abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer &amp; manages to drive the reporters away.Later that day,Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice),Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn&apos;t a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups (who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin&apos;s ownership of Snowflake) may be responsible. At this point,Emilio&apos;s superior,attractive female Lt. Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) comes along and throws Ace out.Ace visits his hacker buddy Woodstock (Raynor Scheine) to try and find information relating to the purchase of equipment that would be necessary for handling a dolphin. Woodstock notices several purchases by a man named Ron Camp,a billionaire who apparently enjoys gathering rare fish. Furthermore,Woodstock notes that Camp donated land to the Miami Dolphins for the building of a new stadium.Ace decides to investigate Ron Camp further &amp; gets into a party thrown by Camp that evening with Melissa. As Camp attempts to seduce Melissa,Ventura investigates Camp&apos;s home &amp; finds a large aquarium tank that he assumes holds the missing Snowflake. However,the tank actually holds a large shark &amp; Ace barely escapes with his life.As Melissa &amp; Ace leave the party,the detective notices an unusual ring on Camp&apos;s hand,manhandling the billionaire in order to get a closer look. When they return to the stadium,Ace informs Melissa of the stone he found in Snowflake&apos;s tank-and Camp&apos;s ring had the same kind of stones (but since no stones were missing,Camp was not the one responsible for Snowflake&apos;s abduction). The ring in question is a 1984 AFC Championship Ring,won by the Miami Dolphins. Ace decides to personally investigate all the ring-owners to find one with a missing stone,but before long his photographic list of suspects has run out with no results.Melissa attempts to console Ace about his failure to find the damaged ring. Ace is in no mood for her and they trade insults. As Ace goes inside to apologize,Melissa receives a devastating phone call- Roger Podacter is dead.The police investigate Podacter&apos;s apartment,learning that Roger&apos;s body was found after crashing through a sunroof twenty stories below his apartment balcony. Lt. Einhorn is in charge of the investigation and she is prepared to pronounce Podacter&apos;s death a suicide. Ace,however,disagrees- insisting that Roger was murdered. After interviewing Podacter&apos;s neighbor (who heard a scream in the apartment) and the manager (who opened the balcony door to check the place),Ace&apos;s theory is proven- Roger&apos;s balcony door is made of soundproof glass &amp; thus Roger&apos;s neighbor couldn&apos;t have heard a scream with the door closed- meaning that somebody else closed the door upon leaving the apartment after throwing Roger Podacter over the balcony.Despite proving his theory to the police,Ace is still upset about not finding the correct ring. Melissa takes Ace to the stadium office to investigate paperwork regarding the sale of the rings. There,Ace spots an unfamiliar player face that was not in his previous checklist. Melissa tells Ace that the player is a mid-season replacement kicker named Ray Finkle. Furthermore,Finkle is the player who allegedly kept the Dolphins from winning the 1984 Super Bowl- by missing the final field goal in an event known as &quot;The Kick Heard Round The World.&quot; As a result of this,Finkle&apos;s contract with the Dolphins was not renewed and he never played football again.Ace drives to Finkle&apos;s childhood home and finds it covered in graffiti and damages from the still-bitter townsfolk. Finkle&apos;s father is outwardly hostile,pointing a gun at Ace until Mrs. Finkle,senile yet doting over her absentee son. Ventura learns that Ray Finkle was institutionalized in a private hospital several years ago,but escaped soon after. A tour of Finkle&apos;s room shows a testament to his hatred of Dan Marino,the player who held the ball for Finkle&apos;s Kick and who Ray blames for the whole thing (insisting that Marino held the ball &quot;laces in&quot; instead of out,per regulations).Realizing that Marino is likely in danger,Ace telephones Melissa and requests extra security for the star player. Marino is filming a commercial for Isotoner gloves when he is tackled by two men in Miami Dolphins uniforms-apparently as part of the commercial. But when the &quot;Dolphins&quot; keep carrying Dan after the director yells CUT,everyone realizes what has happened. Ace attempts to stop the abductors but they evade capture.Einhorn finds Ace in her office after a press interview,infuriating her- until Ace mentions the name Ray Finkle. Ace shares his theory with the lieutenant- Finkle has come back to take his revenge right at Super Bowl time,when it will be most harmful to the Dolphins. Snowflake was the first target of revenge because the dolphin had been given Finkle&apos;s old number and taught to kick a field goal as part of the halftime show. Ace also theorizes that Podacter was murdered because he recognized Finkle from his previous tenure with the Dolphins. Lt. Einhorn actually applauds Ace&apos;s work,making physical advancements towards the pet detective- which Ace rebuffs.Desperate to find out more about Ray Finkle,Ace goes to the mental hospital where the ex-player was held in an attempt to search through any remaining belongings. Melissa poses as an anguished sister looking to commit her deranged,football-obsessed brother to give Ace a chance to explore the hospital. A check of the storage room reveals further examples of Finkle&apos;s hatred of Dan Marino along with an unusual news article- the failure of search parties to locate a missing hiker named Lois Einhorn.Emilio checks out Lt. Einhorn&apos;s desk at police headquarters,finding a love letter to the lieutenant from Roger Podacter dated several days before Rogers&apos; death. Ace struggles to find the possible link between Finkle and Einhorn but cannot see any viable connection. When Ace&apos;s pet dog lies on a picture of Finkle (covering the player&apos;s short black hair with long red threads) Ventura finally realizes the truth- Finkle IS Einhorn! Ace is overjoyed at finding the answer,but repulsed by the knowledge that the lieutenant who attempted to seduce him is actually a man.On the morning of the Super Bowl,Ace tails Einhorn to a remote boathouse where Dan Marino &amp; Snowflake are being kept. Ace manages to defeat Einhorn&apos;s two henchmen but is caught by Einhorn and held at gunpoint before he can free Marino. Einhorn radios the police for assistance,claiming Ace is the one behind the abductions.Einhorn is distracted by a news report on the Super Bowl,repeating the &apos;84 &quot;Kick Heard Round The World&quot; clip. In her rage,Ace is able to overpower her &amp; Snowflake takes the lieutenant&apos;s gun away. As the police arrive,Einhorn orders them to shoot Ace- until Melissa arrives holding Emilio at gunpoint to distract the other police officers enough to let Ace finish the case.Ace explains the full details of Finkle&apos;s new career and plan,ripping off Lt. Einhorn&apos;s clothes in an effort to prove his point. However,Ace&apos;s efforts only seem to prove that Einhorn is a genuine female. However,Dan Marino spots the truth- Einhorn has male genitalia tucked between her (his?) legs. Ace realizes that this is why Roger Podacter died- he learned of Einhorn&apos;s true gender!Enraged,Einhorn attempts to stab the pet detective but Ace knocks her into the water with Snowflake. Einhorn staggers back out (her red hair now washed back to black thanks to the watter) and Ace notices a ring on her finger. Ventura leans over and cheers in triumph- it is indeed the AFC Championship ring,missing a stone.Dan Marino and Snowflake are both returned to the Miami stadium in time for the Super Bowl halftime show. At the same time,Ace spots the rare bird he had been chasing at the beginning of the movie- only to have it chased away by the opposing teams&apos; mascot. Ace and the costumed man get into a fight just as the stadium announcer brings the camera onto Ace Ventura to thank the pet detective for his actions in saving the Dolphins.</Plot>

        <Plot>After failing the rescue attempt of a raccoon in the Himalayas (a parody of the opening to the film Cliffhanger),Ace Ventura undergoes an emotional breakdown and goes on a personal soul-searching quest by becoming a Tibetan monk. He is approached by Fulton Greenwall,a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace&apos;s influence is disruptive to the monastery,the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.&#x0A;Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka,which has become a point of contention. Shikaka,which is a great white bat,is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken,the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey,Spike,Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.&#x0A;After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate,Vincent Cadby,Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace,normally an animal lover,must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case. He travels to the Wachati tribal village,where he learns that Shikaka is meant as a wedding present from the Wachati Princess,who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince. If the bat is not returned in time,the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe instead. Much of Ace&apos;s activity involves eliminating various suspects and enduring the problems of dealing with the Wachati and the Wachootoo,who refer to him as the &quot;white devil&quot;. This proves difficult,and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him.&#x0A;Reduced to the limit of his ability to solve mysteries,Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection. Advised by the Abbot,Ace finally discovers that Vincent Cadby had taken the bat and hired Ace as a cover for his own crimes. Cadby plans to let the tribes destroy each other and take possession of their land,using the numerous bat caves containing guano to sell as fertilizer. Ace manages to thwart Cadby&apos;s plans. However,tribal security chief Hitu is by Cadby&apos;s side and sends him to jail,but Ace calls an elephant to escape,and then summons herds of animals,crushing Cadby&apos;s house. He tries to shoot Ace with a shotgun,but he is knocked out by Greenwall&apos;s fist. After waking up,Cadby manages to escape,with the bat,in a car and Ace chases him in a monster truck. Ace throws the truck&apos;s cigarette lighter at Cadby in an attempt to distract him,who finally rams into a tree and the cage with the bat flies away. Ace runs over Cadby&apos;s car,while Cadby runs away.&#x0A;Ace,tries to chase him,but when he sees that the sun is rising,he confronts his phobia and dramatically returns the bat to the tribes by running through their battlefield with it clutched in his hands,while screaming its name. Cadby,who was covertly watching,is discovered when Ouda sees him and calls out to alert the nearby warriors that another &quot;white devil&quot; is in the area. He is then pursued by both tribes. Meanwhile,Ace accomplishes his mission when he puts (displeased) the bat in his cage. Cadby,who was pursued,ends up lost,out of sight of the tribes. While he was laughing in safety in a tree,he ends up in the hands of an amorous silverback gorilla. The Princess is married to the Prince,who earlier appeared as a champion wrestler sent to challenge Ace&apos;s presence in the tribe. Moments later,it is discovered to the tribes&apos; displeasure that the young bride is no longer a virgin,apparently due to Ace&apos;s intervention. Both of the tribes promptly pursue Ace,concluding the film.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens with a solitary figure,Jude (Jim Sturgess),sitting on a quiet beach front. He is singing &quot;Girl&quot; with a melancholy air,while looking off into the distant horizon. It&apos;s the end of the work day as Jude lines up with his fellow shipyard hands for their day&apos;s wages. After receiving payment from the old man in charge,Jude walks back home,smiling along the way.As he leaves,&quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; begins,while we flash to an idealistic prom scene,where Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) dances along with her boyfriend Daniel (Spencer Liff) and their high-school classmates. A classic band plays along,as Lucy sings to Daniel &quot;Tell me I&apos;m the only one...&quot;In another part of the world,another couple in Liverpool is singing the same song as they dance at a dark underground Liverpool bar - a reference to &quot;The Cavern Club,&quot; where the Beatles began their career. Jude holds his girlfriend (Lisa Hogg) as she sings &quot;Let me go on loving you.&quot; Ambling along a dark and damp street after leaving the bar,Jude and his girlfriend hold hands and trip along the cobblestone. They stop to kiss along the road,as she tells Jude not to forget her while he is in America. He laughs and consoles her,singing &quot;While I&apos;m away,I&apos;ll write home everyday,and I&apos;ll send all my loving to you.&quot; While Jude continues to sing &quot;All My Loving,&quot; he packs his bag,kisses his mom (Angela Mounsey) goodbye,and heads off to the docks to board a ship to America,seeking out his estranged father in New Jersey.Lucy,back at Daniel&apos;s house,is seeing him off to boot camp,and the Vietnam War. Daniel,dressed in his new uniform,drives away while Lucy runs after the car down the street. We then see Lucy sitting on her bed writing a letter,clearly for Daniel.In an army vehicle we see Daniel reading the letter presumably from Lucy as him and his fellow recruits drive away from Boot Camp. The vehicle drives past a high school football field,where football practice is winding down,with cheerleaders&#x0A;running through their routines and watching the football players on the&#x0A;field.After practice ends,one of the cheerleaders,Prudence (T.V. Carpio),watches wistfully as a fellow cheerleader flirts with one of the players. She softly sings &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; as she watches her obvious object of affection walking away with the jock. As she watches them and sings,she walks off the field,into the unknown. We then see her on the side of the road,her thumb out,trying to get it ride to where ever it is she&apos;s headed. In a different part of America,Jude is doing exactly the same thing. A car pulls over for him and,momentarily trying to get in on the wrong side before realizing American cars are different,he gets in.Jude arrives at Princeton University and stands on the academic quad&#x0A;while a student,obviously in a rush,tears his way through the campus&#x0A;crowd and drops all of his books and papers. While stooping down to&#x0A;help collect the papers,Jude asks the student if he knows a certain&#x0A;Professor,believing him to be his father. The student,Max (Joe&#x0A;Anderson),is first at a loss,until he realizes that Jude is looking&#x0A;for the school janitor (Robert Clohessy). He laughs,and points to a&#x0A;man washing windows on a ladder,saying &quot;That&apos;s him.&quot;Introducing himself to the window washer,Jude explains who he is,and his reason for being at the school. At first,the man is surprised,saying that he didn&apos;t know the mother was pregnant,and that he would have married Jude&apos;s mother if he had known. Jude assures him that this apology wasn&apos;t what he wanted,but just wanted &quot;them each to know that the other existed.&quot;Max,the charming and outgoing student from earlier,is on a roof with&#x0A;a few of his buddies as they chip golf balls off of a beer bottle at&#x0A;the nearby dormitory windows. After a few misses,he finally connects -&#x0A;and the group flees the angry mob that spills out of the dorm. Jude,&#x0A;seeing the commotion while out having a cigarette in front of the&#x0A;building that his father is letting him stay in,lets Max slip in to&#x0A;hide. Grateful,Max invites Jude to go out for the night with himself&#x0A;and his golfing buddies. While proclaiming that they get by &quot;With a&#x0A;Little Help From My Friends,&quot; they smoke and drink their way through&#x0A;town until they finally collapse on couches from exhaustion.Lucy walks home from school with her friend,while she talks about&#x0A;missing her boyfriend Daniel. As they walk up to Lucy&apos;s house,her mom&#x0A;hands her a letter while smiling; it&apos;s a letter from Daniel saying that&#x0A;he has been able to get a few weeks leave,and will be home soon to&#x0A;visit. Lucy launches into song as she flies up the stairs,excited to&#x0A;know that &quot;It Won&apos;t Be Long&quot; before she&apos;ll be back together with&#x0A;Daniel.For Thanksgiving break,Max invites Jude to his parents&apos; house for the&#x0A;holidays. After picking up Max&apos;s little sister,who turns out to be&#x0A;Lucy,they continue on in his convertible to see the family. At dinner,&#x0A;Max announces that he is dropping out of college,and going to New York to make a living. A family argument ensues,and the three decide to go out bowling to release some tension.At the alley,while they joke around and tease each other,Jude thinks to himself that he&apos;s &quot;falling,yes he is falling&quot; for Lucy while singing &quot;I&apos;ve Just Seen A Face.&quot; When he and Max drive away to a new life in New York City,Max warns Jude that Lucy has a boyfriend. Jude smiles and assures him that It&apos;s ok,he has a girlfriend too.Jude and Max arrive in the city,and after climbing to the top of a&#x0A;walk-up building,they enter a large apartment owned by a tall singer&#x0A;named Sadie (Dana Fuchs). She shows them the apartment,while several other people lounge around playing the guitar or reading. Pleased with the apartment,they agree to pay two weeks rent in advance,and become New York City residents.Moving to the streets of Detroit during the race riots,a little boy cowers next to a destroyed car on fire,while black men and women run on the streets from the police. Staring out at the audience,he sings &quot;Let It Be&quot; among the violence. Moving into a church in the black community,while the choir swells,we see the same little boy laying in a coffin,obviously a casualty of the fight. JoJo (Martin Luther) stands holding an older woman while she weeps,staring at the little boy&apos;s lifeless body. The little boy is his younger brother.Experiencing the same grief,we see Lucy weeping after a letter comes to Daniel&apos;s parents,notifying him of his death. She too,stares at the burial of her boyfriend,as Marines fold up the American flag and hand it to the mother Daniel has left behind.As the song ends,JoJo slings a guitar over his shoulder,and walks&#x0A;down the street,heading to New York City himself. As he steps along,&#x0A;&quot;Come Together&quot; plays to the beat. He walks down the street,and sees a sign for Guitarist Needed at the bar &quot;Café Huh?&quot; and enters. Sadie is&#x0A;there,and gives him the role of lead guitarist in her band. He comes&#x0A;to the apartment to live; one night while he is playing out a song on&#x0A;his guitar for Jude,a water-logged Prudence climbs into their bathroom&#x0A;window out of the rain,and becomes their newest roommate.After graduating from high school,Lucy joins her brother Max and&#x0A;friend Jude in the city for the summer before she goes to college. She&#x0A;is happy to see her brother,but is reluctant to give him the letter&#x0A;that came for him - a draft notice from the government. At a party they&#x0A;have at the apartment that night,Jude falls again for Lucy,and breaks&#x0A;up with a girl that he was seeing. Lucy sings &quot;If I Fell&quot; while they&#x0A;dance,and finally kiss.The next day,Max reports to the draft office for his physical,and&#x0A;despite swallowing an entire box of cotton balls in the hopes that it&#x0A;will show up as a shadow in x-rays,is deemed qualified for service.&#x0A;While he and a large group of men all endure rigorous physicals,they&#x0A;imagine an animated poster of Uncle Sam singing to them &quot;I Want You.&quot;Back at the apartment,Prudence is mourning the coupling of JoJo and&#x0A;Sadie,after she finds herself infatuated with the tall singer. She&#x0A;locks herself into the closet,and the others sing &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; to&#x0A;coax her out of her hiding place. Despite this,Prudence leaves&#x0A;unexpectedly; no one is sure where she goes.The remaining gang goes to a party where an agent tries to convince&#x0A;Sadie to go solo. Tripping out on pink punch,the group hops on a&#x0A;psychedelic bus trip across the country. At a stop in a field,they see&#x0A;a traveling circus run by Mr. Kite,and find Prudence in the troupe&#x0A;dating a contortionist named Rita.Max is now off to war,leaving Lucy angry and distraught. After seeing&#x0A;an anti-war speaker in the park,she decides to join their organization&#x0A;to protest Vietnam and bring the troops home. As Lucy devotes more and more time to the organization,Jude becomes jealous of the man that runs the group.Sadie has finally told the rest of the band that she is planning on&#x0A;going solo. Infuriated,JoJo purposefully ruins her opening song &quot;Oh!&#x0A;Darling&quot; with distracting and awful guitar riffs,which forces her to&#x0A;leave the stage. Having his own relationship trouble,Jude sinks into his artistic work while singing &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot; He and Lucy have now fought over her increasing involvement and obsession with her anti-war group,culminating in Jude confronting her at their headquarters while singing &quot;Revolution.&quot;After being kicked out,he walks by a window display of tthe announcement of the assassination of Martin Luther King,Jr. &quot;While&#x0A;My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; starts playing. He meets up with JoJo and gets drunk,only to find that Lucy has moved all of her belongings out of&#x0A;the apartment,leaving him. Later that day,he gets on a subway (to the&#x0A;song &quot;Across The Universe&quot;) to go to Columbia University,where the&#x0A;anti-war group&apos;s actions escalate to increasing violence,leading to&#x0A;police action at a rally at Columbia University.Sadie starts singing &quot;Helter,Skelter&quot; at a club,while Jude,walking through,sees Lucy as one of the protesters being arrested by the police,and attempts to save her while she is being dragged away. She calls out to him,but he is overcome by the police and is arrested.At the same time,Max gets into a firefight,where he has to shoot a lot. He gets injured and has a dream sequence about naked Vietnamese mothers floating in the river.Meanwhile,Jude sits in his jail cell,as more and more prisoners are&#x0A;let free to go home. Finally,alone,his father comes to visit him. His&#x0A;father breaks the news that although the police will not press charges,&#x0A;he is being forced to leave the country and return to England. He&#x0A;encounters Molly,his old flame,who is now pregnant with Phil&apos;s child.While he is walking home,the scene cuts to Lucy at Max&apos;s bedside in&#x0A;the V A hospital. He starts singing &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; in a&#x0A;sequence with Salma Hayek as a nurse.At one of her rallies,Lucy is in a phone booth,while her mother pleads with her on the phone to be careful and begs her to stop her involvement in the protests. Resolved,she argues with her mother,when a fight breaks out,and a gun shot hits the phone booth. Lucy tells her mother she has to go and hangs up,then screams as she sees a protestor being savaged by a police dog next to the phone booth. Not hurt but shaking in terror,Lucy sinks down while singing to herself that it&apos;ll be alright. TV scenes of the DC protests and the Pentagon protest show while Max is watching from the V A hospital. Lucy goes back to the old protest headquarters and finds Paco making pipe bombs.&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is playing as Jude gets off work,and he gets a newspaper and sees that the place where the protesters were organized from had blown up. Cut to him sitting on the beach... then cut to the wharf area in NY,where Max is sitting and Lucy sings &quot;Blackbird&quot;,while Jude wanders the beach and tidal areas in Liverpool.Jude gets back into his routine at the shipyards,then sits in a pub after work,drinking a pint. To the words of &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; sung by Max (as imagined by Jude as sitting next to him,while he is looking into a mirror behind the bar),he runs to his house to again pack his bags,and returns to the States (with a visa) to get back Lucy. Max meets him at Customs,and takes him to the building where Sadie and JoJo&apos;s reunited band is playing &quot;Don&apos;t Let Me Down&quot; to a cheering crowd on the streets.Lucy,not knowing Jude is back,is invited with a note by Max to come to the concert. She is about to press the buzzer when she sees the strawberry logo Jude designed for Sadie,and old memories of her and Jude and the pain of the breakup come rushing back,and she walks away hurriedly. The police break up the concert as the crowd gathering gets larger. Jude hides from the police,and after being left alone on the roof,starts singing &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; into the microphone. Sadie,JoJo,Prudence,Max,and the rest all rush back up to the roof,and join in. Lucy hears Jude&apos;s voice,and frantically rushes to get into the building,only to be stopped by the police. She turns,and runs to a building across the street,and stares at Jude from the roof across the way. As the rest of the band join in with song,Jude catches Lucy&apos;s eye from across the building. She smiles as a tear runs down her cheek. Jude sighs and a smile of happiness slowly spreads across his face. Together in the end,they kiss as &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; plays during the end credits.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with an American Special Forces unit capturing General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow),the dictator of Kazakhstan. Radek&apos;s regime had caused an enormous amount of bloodshed for Kazakhstan,and there was word that his stockpiling of nuclear weapons would have plunged the world into a second cold war. His capture was made through the joint cooperation of President James Marshall (Harrison Ford),and Russian President Petrov (Alan Woolf).Several weeks after the capture of Radek,President Marshall visits Moscow,along with his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). While Marshall is praised for his help in freeing Kazakhstan from Radek&apos;s grip,Marshall surprises everyone (including his own men) by deviating from his planned speech. Marshall says that they were too slow to act,and vows to not have such a thing happen again.Marshall,his family,and his men are then returned to Air Force One,which takes off on its return trip to Washington D.C. Unknown to the President or anyone else,a rogue secret service agent named Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) has secretly allowed access into the plane several men who are supporters of Generak Radek. Gibbs kills several agents in a crucial protective position on the plane and the hijackers,led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman),don bulletproof vests and manage to gain weaponry that is used by the Secret Service. In the chaos,Marshall is ordered into an escape pod in the cargo hold.Air Force One&apos;s pilots attempt an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Base,but are soon killed with one of Ivan&apos;s men taking control of the plane. A group of F-15&apos;s are sent after Air Force One as an escort. The plane is piloted towards Kazakhstan,and Ivan places a direct call to the White House,where Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) and Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell) listen to Korshunov&apos;s demands. Ivan requests the release of General Radek,with the stipulation that a hostage will be executed every half hour until his demands are met. Shortly thereafter,the President&apos;s escape pod is found,but he is not inside. During the firefight,Marshall stayed aboard the plane,intent on saving his family,a fact that neither the White House or Korshunov are aware. Korshunov assumes that the President escaped Air Force One,while the empty pod&apos;s discovery by the White House has them speculating that Korshunov and his men have killed Marshall.Bennett calls Petrov,in hopes that he can release Radek temporarily (with the hope that once Ivan has released the hostages,they can quickly recapture him). However,Petrov is not willing to give into this request without proof that the President is alive. After 30 minutes,Korshunov calls the White House to find out if Radek has been released. When Bennett tries to stall for time,Korshunov shoots National Security Advisor Jack Doherty (Tom Everett). Korshunov then has Grace and Alice brought to the cockpit,leaving several men to guard the rest of the hostages.Marshall attempts to find his family,but almost is taken out by a henchman,before he kills him. Marshall returns to the cargo hold where he manages to find a cellular phone,and places a call to the White House switchboard. Marshall argues with the switchboard operator when she questions his claim to be The President,and he demands she trace the call. As she realizes that Marshall is who he says he is,one of Ivan&apos;s henchmen finds Marshall. Marshall sticks the phone in his pocket. At this point,the call is transferred through to the White House situation room,and Marshall gives indirect orders for one of the F-15&apos;s escorting the plane to fire on them. Bennett relays the order,and the shockwave from the blast throws the henchman off-balance,allowing Marshall to kill him. Marshall then speaks directly to Bennett and the others,claiming they cannot give up Radek,and need to find some way to get the plane on the ground.During this time,Korshunov has found out about the killing of two of his men,and has assumed there is a Secret Service agent hiding in the cargo hold. After having Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel (Donna Bullock) brought to the cockpit,he turns on the plane&apos;s speaker system,threatening to kill Melanie if the person in the cargo hold does not show themselves. Painfully,Marshall does not comply,and Melanie&apos;s execution is heard throughout the plane.In a storage fridge in the cargo hold,Marshall notices a punctured milk container,and gets the idea to cause the plane to leak fuel,which should force the plane to land. When the plane registers that it is leaking fuel,Ivan sends two of his men to check on this. They are almost killed by Marshall,but as they go to fix the fuel leak,Marshall sneaks up to the main cabin,and subdues another henchmen.The two then gain entrance to the room where the hostages are. Marshall claims he is not leaving without his family,but wants to save the hostages. Major Caldwell (William H Macy) proposes that if they can get the plane to descent to 15,000 feet,and use the parachutes in the cargo hold,they can get off the plane. The secret fax message (the fax and phone lines are separate)is received by the White House,shortly after Korshunov calls demanding a mid-air refueling. Bennett attempts once more to negotiate for a hostage release by requesting they land the plane for refueling,but Korshunov&apos;s threat to kill a passenger every minute until they are refueled causes her to give into his demands for a mid-air refuel. Bennett soon has to deal with the matter in another way,when CNN reports of a rumor that Air Force One has crashed. Bennett goes before the White House Press Room to quell the rumor,and informs the public for the first time regarding the hijacking of the airplane.A KC-10 is dispatched and soon after refuels Air Force One. Caldwell and several others activate the cargo hold doors,and numerous people begin dropping from the plane,activating their parachutes. However,the opening of the cargo doors is seen in the plane&apos;s controls,and several of Korshunov&apos;s men are sent to investigate. Finding the door locked,one of them uses an oxygen tank to blast the lock,causing a number of people to plummet out of the plane. The sudden blast causes the refueling effort to go wrong,and the KC-10 struggles to break free. However,this causes the fuel leaking from the plane to ignite and the refueling plane explodes.Marshall just barely survives being sucked out the cargo hold,clinging to part of the cargo door. Caldwell manages to save Marshall,and they are soon taken hostage by Korshunov&apos;s men. Ivan then calls the White House,announcing that he now has the President,and orders the F-15 escort to divert once they enter Kazakhstan airspace. Bennett immediately complies with this request.Marshall is brought before Korshunov,who demands that Marshall call Petrov to release Radek,promising that they can go free once the General is released. Marshall refuses,until Korshunov threatens to kill Alice. Forced to save his family,Marshall gives in,and calls Petrov for the release of Radek. As Radek&apos;s release is broadcast through the plane&apos;s P.A. system,Korshunov explains further that he lied to Marshall. He further intends to turn Marshall and his family over to Radek.During this time,Marshall manages to get hold of a piece of glass,and cut through his bindings. Marshall then attempts to subdue Korshunov,but is almost shot by one of Korshunov&apos;s henchman. The bullet meant for Marshall is taken by Agent Johnson. Marshall then manages to take out the gunman,but in the ensuing struggle,Ivan escapes to the cargo hold with Grace. Marshall finds Korshunov wearing a parachute,but also throwing the remaining chutes out the open hold door. Korshunov mocks that with no one to fly the plane and no parachutes,he has won. His short-lived victory is enough time for Grace to distract him,before Marshall tackles Korshunov. As they struggle,Marshall wraps a strap around Korshunov&apos;s neck before activating his parachute. The strap snaps Korshunov&apos;s neck,killing him as he is pulled out the cargo hold door.Marshall manages to call Petrov and halt the release Radek. However,Radek makes a run for it when ordered to halt,and is killed. Marshall manages to get assistance from a friend in the White House on how to pilot Air Force One,with Caldwell serving as co-pilot. The plane heads for an airfield in Turkey,but is soon intercepted by some rogue MIG fighters piloted by Radek loyalists. The F-15&apos;s that turned away at Kazakhstan&apos;s borders move in to intercept the MIG&apos;s. However,in the firefight,Air Force One loses an engine and suffers major damage to its tail gear,preventing a safe landing.With no way to land and the plane losing fuel,a C-130 Hercules is routed towards Air Force One,and a mid-air &quot;zipline&quot; rescue is put into effect. Though efforts are made to save Marshall first,he demands that his wife and daughter be transferred first. The wounded Agent is the third person across,but due to Air Force One&apos;s continued engine failure and rapid descent,only one more person can be rescued. Marshall refuses to leave the other men behind,but his words are interrupted as Agent Gibbs shoots the zipline attendant,and also kills Caldwell. Both Gibbs and Marshall fight for the zipline strap,with Marshall just barely getting it attached when the zipline breaks free from the doorframe,leaving Gibbs aboard the plane as it crashes and breaks up in the Caspian Sea.Marshall continues to struggle to secure his zipline strap as the team aboard the Hercules reels him in. Once he is finally secure aboard the Hercules,the pilot changes the plane&apos;s call-sign from &quot;Liberty 2-4&quot; to &quot;Air Force One&quot; (this title applies to any aircraft that the President is aboard). As Marshall is reunited with his family,the F-15 squadron resumes flanking positions as they escort the First Family home.</Plot>

        <Plot>Lester Burnham (Spacey) is a 42-year-old father,husband and advertising executive who serves as the film&apos;s narrator. Lester&apos;s relationship with his wife Carolyn (Bening),an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential,is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring,faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated,however,when he meets Jane&apos;s friend and classmate,the egotistical Angela Hayes (Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela,much to his daughter&apos;s embarrassment. Throughout the film,Lester has fantasies involving a sexually aggressive Angela and red rose petals. The Burnhams&apos; new neighbors are Col. Frank Fitts,USMC (Cooper),his distracted wife Barbara (Janney),and his camcorder-obsessed son Ricky (Bentley). When confronted with the gay couple living two doors down,Col. Fitts displays a distinctly bigoted attitude.Over the course of a few days,each of the Burnhams individually makes a life-changing choice. Carolyn meets real estate rival Buddy Kane for a business lunch and ends up beginning an affair with him,and later takes up shooting lessons (a suggestion of Kane&apos;s). Lester blackmails his boss for $60,000,quits his job,and takes up low-pressure employment as a burger-flipper at a fast food chain. He continues to liberate himself by trading in his Toyota Camry for his dream car,a 1970 Pontiac Firebird,starts working out to impress Angela,and starts smoking a genetically enhanced form of marijuana. Jane,while growing distant from Angela,develops a romantic relationship with Ricky,having bonded over what he considers to be his most beautiful camcorder footage he has ever filmed,that of a plastic grocery bag dancing in the wind. Ricky himself quickly befriends Lester and secretly acts as Lester&apos;s marijuana supplier.Col. Fitts,concerned over the growing relationship between Lester and Ricky,roots through his son&apos;s possessions,finding footage of Lester working out in the nude (captured by chance while Ricky was filming Jane through her bedroom window)- slowly bringing him to the conclusion that his son is gay. Buddy and Carolyn are found out by Lester,who seems to be mostly unfazed by his wife&apos;s infidelity. Carolyn,who is almost more devastated by Lester&apos;s indifference than by her being exposed as an adulteress,is further dismayed when Buddy reacts by breaking off the affair. As evening falls,Ricky returns home to find his father waiting for him with fists and vitriol,having mistaken his drug rendezvous with Lester for a sexual affair. Realising this as an opportunity for freedom,Ricky falsely agrees that he is gay and goads his violent father until he is thrown out. Ricky rushes to Jane&apos;s house and asks her to flee with him to New York City - something she agrees to,much to the dismay of Angela,who quickly protests. Ricky shoots her down with her deepest fear: that she is boring and completely ordinary and uses her &quot;friends&quot;,like Jane,to boost her public image. Broken and dismayed,Angela storms out of the room,leaving Jane and Ricky to reconcile.Lester finds an emotionally fragile Col. Fitts standing outside in the pouring rain and attempts to comfort him,but is taken by surprise when Fitts kisses him. Lester gently rebuffs him,telling him he has the wrong idea. Fitts,shamed and broken,wanders back into the rain. Meanwhile,Carolyn sits alone in her car on the side of the road,holding her gun and becoming more and more infuriated at the day&apos;s turn of events. Moments later,Lester finds a distraught Angela and is on the edge of consummating their relationship,but the seduction is derailed when she confesses that she is a virgin. Now viewing her only as an innocent child,Lester immediately withdraws,his affections shifting to that of a father-figure,and they bond over their shared frustrations with and concern for Jane,Lester seeming to be pleased when Angela confesses that Jane&apos;s in love. Angela asks how he&apos;s feeling and he realizes,to his own surprise,that he feels great. After Angela excuses herself to the bathroom,a happy Lester sits at the table looking at a photograph of his family in happier times,unaware of the gun being held to the back of his head.In his final narration,Lester looks back on the events of his life,intertwined with images of everyone&apos;s reactions to the sound of the subsequent gunshot,including one of a bloody and shaken Col. Fitts with a gun missing from his collection. Despite his death,Lester,from his vantage point as narrator,is content:&quot;I guess I could be really pissed off about what happened to me...but it&apos;s hard to stay mad,when there&apos;s so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I&apos;m seeing it all at once,and it&apos;s too much,my heart fills up like a balloon that&apos;s about to burst...and then I remember to relax,and stop trying to hold on to it,and then it flows through me like rain. And I can&apos;t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. You have no idea what I&apos;m talking about,I&apos;m sure. But don&apos;t worry... you will someday.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>In the opening scene,we see a young skinhead white supremacist by the name of Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) sitting in the principals office,waiting to be summoned. As we move into the office,we hear and see Danny&apos;s history teacher,Mr. Murray (Elliot Gould),explaining to the principal,Dr. Robert Sweeney (Avery Brooks),that Danny wrote a book report on Mein Kampf,a book detailing Hitler and his memoirs. Murray tells Dr. Sweeney that he is offended by Danny&apos;s gesture and he wants to see him punished. Instead,Sweeney asks Murray to leave and asks Danny to step in. American flag toothpick in mouth,Danny steps into the office and sits down. Dr. Sweeney begins yelling at Danny,telling him that writing what he did is offensive and he only did it because his brother influenced him in that way. Danny argues of course but in the end Sweeney wins and tells him that he is now his new history teacher. The class is called American History X and the next assignment is due tomorrow morning; a paper on his brother,Derek (Edward Norton). After this,Danny walks out. The next scene opens in the school bathroom with three black boys beating up a white boy for telling the teacher that one of them cheated. Suddenly,Danny appears out of one of the stalls and demands that they stop. One boy,Henry,argues with him but Danny simply blows the smoke from his cigarette into his face. The boys leave,Danny helps the white kid from the ground and tells him that he needs to learn to stand up for himself and they leave. Soon we see Danny walking home from school through a park where some black men are playing basketball; one is Henry. Danny&apos;s voice begins to narrate the scene and we learn that before Derek went to jail,the white kids didn&apos;t have to be afraid of the black kids,Derek made it safe.The next scenes are flashbacks explaining Derek&apos;s journey from a suburban white kid to a vengeance-seeking white supremacist. When Danny and Derek were younger,a black drug dealer shot their father while he was fighting a fire. Soon after that,an old white supremacist by the name of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) sought out Derek,hoping to begin a new movement throughout the suburban white kid culture. Cameron told Derek that what happened to his father was an act of racism by the black man and it wasn&apos;t right and he,or any other white kid,shouldn&apos;t be scared. So Derek began rounding up scared suburban white kids for his new gang and telling them that there was nothing to be afraid of anymore. This new craze became so popular among the kids of Venice Beach that Derek soon became an icon. His legacy started then and continued even throughout the time he spent in jail. The night Derek went to jail,three black guys were trying to break into his car and Danny heard them so he told Derek. He rushed downstairs,gun in hand,and opened the door and began shooting the men. He knocked off two of the three but one man wasn&apos;t dead yet so Derek demanded the man to put his teeth on the curb and not move. Then he broke the man&apos;s neck. Almost immediately the police arrive and take Derek away.In jail,Derek tried to find a group of people to hang out with so that he didn&apos;t have to fend for himself. Not too long after arriving,he found a group of white supremacists that accepted him. As time went by,Derek noticed and started to realize the compromises men made to stay ahead in the jail - because the supremacists were a minority,they paid a non-white gang to keep them safe. When he learned that a fellow white supremacist was doing favors for a Mexican man,he became enraged and stopped interacting with the group. Later,Derek was assigned laundry duty with a black inmate named Lamont. Lamont was friendly toward Derek,but Derek was not friendly back,at first. Soon Lamont and Derek began to befriend each other and became good acquaintances. The friendship angered the white supremacist group even more than they already were because Derek left ,so to get revenge,they jumped Derek in the showers and one of them raped him. The day this happened,Dr. Sweeney,who was also Derek&apos;s teacher,came to visit him. As soon as he arrived,Derek cried and told Sweeney that he wanted out and that he wanted to take everything back and move as far away as possible so he wouldn&apos;t hurt his family anymore. Dr. Sweeney told Derek that it wasn&apos;t enough and that Danny was headed down the same path and he must do whatever was necessary for Danny to not end up like him. Derek agreed and told him that he was ready to do whatever once he was out.Some time later,Derek is released from prison and returns home to find that Danny has become a white supremacist as well. He also learns that what was once a small following has turned into a considerably large one. That night,Danny and Derek both go to a party that Cameron is throwing for Derek&apos;s homecoming. Once there,he finds his old girlfriend,Stacey (Fairuza Balk),and asks her to move far away with him. He tells her that he doesn&apos;t want any of this anymore,he&apos;s done with white supremacy. Following that,she asks him if he&apos;s crazy and runs off in anger. After that,Derek looks for Danny and finally finds him in Cameron&apos;s office. Derek tells Danny to leave and that there is a girl outside waiting for him. After Danny leaves,Derek confronts Cameron and tells him that he&apos;s done with the whole white supremacist thing and he knows Cameron&apos;s game. What Derek says infuriates Cameron and they start to argue. The argument ends when Derek punches Cameron in the face and then kicks him again while he&apos;s down. Derek leaves and calls for Danny to come with him. On his way out,Seth Ryan (Ethan Suplee),a friend of Derek&apos;s before he went to jail,starts yelling at him and demanding an answer as to what happened to Cameron. Derek is befuddled and keeps yelling for Danny but then Seth pulls out a gun and points it at Derek. Stacey begins to yell from the side,&quot;Shoot him! Shoot him!&quot; and Seth continues to get closer and closer. Just as Seth is about to do it,Derek grabs the gun and points it up then pushes him and tells him to step away. Derek calls Danny and starts to run away,gun in hand.Soon Danny catches up to him and Derek begins to explain. Even though Danny is frustrated with Derek,because he&apos;s giving up the only thing he thinks brings the white kids hope against the non-white race,he understands and forgives him and they walk home. When they arrive,Danny begins working on his paper and Derek enters the room. They both look at each other and move toward the wall that is covered in white supremacist propaganda; they take everything down. When they&apos;re done,Danny returns to the computer to write his paper and Derek gets into the shower. The following morning,at sunrise,Danny is narrator,telling us the end to his story. He says that he&apos;s never watched the sunrise before and he hopes that this paper is what he,Dr. Sweeney,is looking for.

There,they meet up with Dr. Sweeney and Captain Rasmussen. They tell Derek that Cameron and Seth were found last night after being jumped and they are now in the hospital. Dr. Sweeney and Rasmussen both ask Derek if he knows anything about it and he swears he doesn&apos;t. Derek tells them that he has somewhere to go and that he&apos;s going to walk Danny to school before he goes. They set off on their way. As Derek is dropping him off,he staggers over words and finally says I&apos;ll see you at home. Danny departs for the front doors and Derek heads down the street. While he&apos;s walking,the audience can sense the fear in Derek. At the same time,Danny enters the bathroom just before class starts. What Danny doesn&apos;t know is that Henry is in the bathroom as well. He raises a gun and shoots Danny a number of times and he falls to the ground.Next we see Derek is in the bathroom with Danny. He sits with him and holds his body close to his. The only things we can hear between sobs are the remarks Derek is making to himself about what he&apos;s done. Immediately after,Danny&apos;s voice takes over as narrator and we hear the closing statement of the paper he&apos;s written about Derek:&#x0A;&quot;So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned - my conclusion,right? Well,my conclusion is: Hate is baggage. Life&apos;s too short to be pissed off all the time. It&apos;s just not worth it. Derek says it&apos;s always good to end a paper with a quote. He says someone else has already said it best. So if you can&apos;t top it,steal from them and go out strong. So I picked a guy I thought you&apos;d like. &apos;We are not enemies,but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained,it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched,as surely they will be,by the better angels of our nature.&apos; &quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>American Pie,set in the year 1999,focuses on a group of four close friends in their senior year at the fictional East Great Falls High School in west Michigan; Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas),Chris &quot;Oz&quot; Ostreicher (Chris Klein),Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas),who is better known by his surname. Kevin is confident and charming and is dating his long-term girlfriend,Vicky Lathum (Tara Reid); Oz is a laid-back member of the high school lacrosse team; Jim is socially awkward and sexually naïve and suffers pressure and questionable advice from his father (Eugene Levy); while Finch is a cappuccino-drinking sophisticate who plays golf and wears sports jackets. The four have very differing personalities,but share a common characteristic; they are all virgins,in sharp contrast to popular lacrosse player and arrogant jock Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott),whose wild,extravagant house parties they are regularly invited to.While at one of Stifler&apos;s such parties,the four each attempt to score with various girls at the party with very limited success. Oz is humiliated by an older girl,Finch is too late for the party and Jim attempts to talk to Czechoslovakian exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth),but fails completely. Kevin receives fellatio from Vicky,but she overhears him complaining about it to Jim and promptly dumps him. The next morning,the four wake up hungover and depressed,to find dorky classmate Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen) seeing off a pretty girl,and are left shocked and frustrated when Chuck claims that he lost his virginity to her the same night. Kevin decides to take a stand and proudly declares that the four will make a pact to try and lose their virginity before the school prom and graduation. Later,while eating breakfast in a restaurant,they toast each other to &apos;the next step&apos; and formulate individual plans to achieve sexual success.Kevin sets out to win Vicky back,but has to work very hard to even get a chance with her,and begins to seek advice from others. Vicky&apos;s best friend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) reveals to Kevin that,despite his thinking otherwise,Vicky has never felt an orgasm from Kevin,and that he has to work on that above everything else. His older brother Tom (Casey Affleck) then passes onto Kevin the secret of &apos;The Bible&apos; - a manual of love and sex compiled by various East Great Falls students over several decades. Both Jessica and Tom divulge their advice after Kevin stresses he wants to make Vicky happy and not simply take advantage of her for his pact. Kevin finally seizes a chance to make things up with Vicky,and performs fellatio on her in her bedroom using his new techniques. Vicky experiences an intense orgasm and is driven wild by Kevin,winning him the promise of sex at the prom after-party in the process.Meanwhile,Oz joins the school&apos;s jazz choir in an effort to lose his stereotyped reputation as a lacrosse jock and find a loving girlfriend there. He is mocked relentlessly at first by his friends and the other choir members,but soon wins the attention of Heather (Mena Suvari),one of the choir singers who also suffers being stereotyped as a priss. She swiftly asks him out to the prom with her,but changes her mind upon seeing Stifler and his friends mocking her,and assuming Oz was doing the same. A desperate Oz volunteers to become lead vocalist alongside Heather to try and regain her trust. He succeeds when she catches him rehearsing alone in the theatre,and pays him a visit after-hours at the sandwich bar he works at to reconcile. Their relationship is dealt another blow when Oz realizes his final ever lacrosse game for East Great Falls clashes with the choir competition,but Oz decides to abandon the game halfway-through and rushes over to the music hall,where he makes it just in time. He performs the long-awaited duet with Heather to rapturous applause from the audience,including Kevin and Jim themselves.After Oz describes third base to Jim as &quot;like warm apple pie&quot;,a frustrated Jim temporarily loses his sanity and has full missionary sex with a freshly-baked apple pie left on the table by his mother (giving the film its eponymous title). His father walks in on the act and is left stunned and disappointed by his son&apos;s actions. Now almost without hope,Jim has a stroke of luck when Nadia,seemingly at random,asks him if she can come round to his house and study with him. After dropping the crucial detail that she&apos;ll be coming straight from ballet practice and will need to change,Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch Nadia stripping together over the internet. Upon Nadia&apos;s arrival,Jim sets up the webcam and leaves the room to join Kevin and Finch at Kevin&apos;s house. Against expectation,an almost-naked Nadia discovers Jim&apos;s pornography collection and begins to masturbate on his bed,causing a riotous reaction from Stifler,Kevin and Finch on the other end,as well as Stifler&apos;s young brother Matt (Eli Marienthal).Kevin and Finch force Jim to return to his room and seduce her while the moment lasts,but Nadia forces Jim to strip himself and dance for her while she reads his pornography. By now,various groups of East Great Falls seniors,including members of Blink 182,are watching the live action in excited anticipation,as it is revealed that Jim accidentally addressed the webcam link to everybody in his entire school year. Nadia seduces Jim and sits him down next to her on the bed,but unfortunately,he prematurely ejaculates,disappointing Nadia and completely grossing out his live web audience. A desperate Jim pleads for Nadia not to go and wins her around,but involuntarily ejaculates again upon touching her clitoris. Nadia swiftly exits,leaving Jim a nervous wreck.The next day,Jim has become the laughing stock of the entire high school and is left despondent and depressed,especially upon hearing that Nadia has been immediately sent back home to Czechoslovakia by her sponsors after the incident. However,he senses luck when unpopular band geek Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) begins to talk to him. Upon revealing she knows nothing about the webcam incident,he promptly asks her out to the prom with him,which she accepts.Finch at first appears to have no plan,but Kevin begins to get suspicious when corroborative rumours begin flying around from loads of girls that Finch has legendary sexual prowess,has had relations with older women,and that he even knocked out Stifler in a fight. Kevin investigates and discovers that Finch paid Jessica $200 to spread the rumours under the pretense of truth. Finch quickly becomes the most talked-about and most awe-inspiring senior in the high school,with hoards of girls desperate to go to the prom with him. However,Stifler,angry about the rumours against him,spikes Finch&apos;s mochaccino with laxatives,and promptly dupes him into using the girls&apos; restroom,where Finch suffers explosive diarrhea in the presence of several senior girls. Afterwards,he emerges to a torrent of mockery,laughter and abuse from a mass crowd of seniors,with Stifler at the helm,and is left humiliated,broken and completely dateless.The prom night finally comes around. Finch is the only one of the four who attends alone,but Jessica,feeling guilty for taking his money,offers to dance with him,even giving him a brand new hip flask as a gift. The prom itself is cheap,tacky and uneventful and derided by most of the students,but a cocky,bragging Kevin sees it as a good time to query his friends for a &quot;status check&quot; on their progress in fulfilling the pact. Oz and Finch are disinterested,and a burnt-out Jim finally explodes in anger at Kevin for causing all the pressure,insisting that sex isn&apos;t at all as important as they previously made out. The outburst shatters Kevin&apos;s bravado and makes him wonder whether things will truly go as planned between him and Vicky. However,their spirits are all collectively lifted,when Chuck Sherman&apos;s partner at the prom gets up onto the stage and announces in front of everybody that Chuck is a liar and is actually still a virgin. Chuck wets himself in embarrassment,and the four boys excitedly catch the bus to Stifler&apos;s huge post-prom party at his mansion on Lake Michigan.As the party begins to gain traction,the four boys all individually fulfill their pact with almost no conscious effort. Kevin and Vicky go to an upstairs bedroom where they finally have sex for the first time,but their desires for perfection and timing cause the interaction to become rigid and awkward throughout. While walking along the lakeside,an emotional Oz confesses the pact to Heather,who becomes wary,but he renounces the pact and declares that he&apos;s already won just by being with her at the prom. They passionately embrace each other at the dockside,naturally and fluidly moving into their first sexual experience. Meanwhile,Jim is snoozing through Michelle&apos;s immature band camp stories,but chokes on his drink when she reveals she knows more about orgasms than she&apos;s letting on. Michelle leads him upstairs,where she reveals she actually knew all along about the webcam incident,only accepting Jim&apos;s date because he was a &quot;sure thing&quot;. Jim finally gets to have disaster-free sex,but Michelle is dominant and violently aggressive,shouting abuse at Jim,roughing him up and smashing things up with her hands and feet out of sheer passion. Finally,a bored Finch wanders around restricted areas of the house and bumps into Stifler&apos;s mom (Jennifer Coolidge),whose aura and natural beauty takes him aback. After some sophisticated,upper-class conversation and flirting,she becomes aroused by Finch&apos;s precociousness,and they proceed to make love on the snooker table as the party goes on through the night.Dawn breaks early the next morning,and the partygoers are all fast asleep around the house. Oz watches the sun rise with a smile as Heather snuggles into his lap at the lakeside,the couple looking extremely content. Kevin and Vicky are also awake,but both are contemplative and neither seem happy. Vicky amicably breaks up with Kevin,citing their separation due to their choice of university and the distance between them,a topic she discussed earlier with Jessica. Kevin is left saddened,but accepts Vicky&apos;s reasoning. Meanwhile,Jim wakes up and goes to cuddle Michelle in bed,only to find himself hugging an inflatable shark with no Michelle in sight. He quickly realizes Michelle used and abused him for a sordid one night stand,but is left brimming with happiness at how cool the prospect of being used is. Finally,Finch is asleep with Stifler&apos;s mom when a hungover Stifler enters the room; he is so shocked at Finch sleeping with his mom that he collapses and passes out.Later on,Kevin,Oz,Jim and Finch all go to their favorite hang-out restaurant,the fittingly-named &quot;Dog Years&quot;,for breakfast. Far from celebrating their pact with stories,they all remain very conservative and hushed about their experiences the night before,with Oz refusing to even confirm whether he had sex or not. Regardless,the four lads are now collectively happier than they ever were before,and once again toast each other to &apos;the next step&apos; as they prepare to leave high school and move away to university.The film ends with Jim setting up his webcam in his room once again,and stripping and dancing to country music. Nadia is on the other end,back in her home country,smiling and laughing at Jim. His father walks in on the act,but sees the funny side. He walks out and starts dancing down the corridor,presumably to make love to Jim&apos;s mom,as he seductively mutters &quot;sweetheart!&quot;.</Plot>

        <Plot>After breaking up for the summer,the four friends plan to take off to a beach house together,where they intend to spend the summer. Stifler (Sean William Scott),the oversexed college clown has also been invited along by Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas),having worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them. Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing,often ending up leading the group in their endeavors.Oz (Chris Klein) is lonely,being away from his girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is in Spain. They proceed to start having phone sex to vent some of their frustration,which ends up being interrupted by Stifler. Heather later shows up early to the party,ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in.After arriving in Grand Harbor they manage to find work painting a house (based on the Tuition Painters franchise) in the area together,mistaking the owners for lesbians. Jim (Jason Biggs),Stifler and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) end up performing &quot;like for like&quot; sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the neighborhood.After this,many concurrent stories run at the same time,some interacting with each other,other staying mainly separate.Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth),Jim&apos;s girlfriend from the first American Pie film,is coming to visit him in August. When she arrives early,Jim asks for help from band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan),making a fool out of himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey,a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone. They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his penis to his underpants while watching a porno film and injured himself,leaving him embarrassed and unable to perform). Jim and Michelle break the relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia,but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim,and soon Jim realises that he has fallen for Michelle. Nadia also realizes this and tells him,&quot;Go,get your band geek,and I will find mine&quot;. Jim goes and plays the trombone once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with.Finch has become involved in the sexual art of Tantra,and claims that through Tantra he can &quot;make an orgasm last for days&quot;. He is waiting for Stifler&apos;s Mom (Jennifer Coolidge),who he had sex with in the first film,hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone,but it turns out to be his little brother Matt (Eli Marienthal),the star of later films. He spends the night talking with a few girls,but he doesn&apos;t sleep with any of them.The next morning,after the party,a Mercedes coupe with darkened windows turns up,Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler&apos;s Mom has come after all. He jumps at the chance and they drive off together,Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother. After being asked,she reveals her name is Janine,but also instructs Finch to resume calling her &quot;Stiflers mom&quot; as per usual.The geeky Sherman (Chris Owen) gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and savvy Jessica (Natasha Lyonne),but the rejected Nadia,who wanted Jim because he was a geek,is turned on by his &quot;Shermanator&quot; gimmick,and they end up in bed together.Kevin doesn&apos;t end up &quot;getting off&quot; with anyone,but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky (Tara Reid) after making advances on her throughout the film.</Plot>

        <Plot>No sooner than they arrive,Erik feels let down that he and Cooze will be rooming separately,with Cooze in a single room and him sharing another. Erik is no longer with Tracy,his girlfriend in the last film,as she has left him for her ex-boyfriend Trent,leaving Erik an unconfident shell of his former self. Fate,however,intervenes,and Erik meets a girl named Ashley in the coed bathrooms,courtesy of his more party prone,sex crazed cousin Dwight. Things seem to be going well for him during this brief introduction; however,it is cut short when Erik urinates on his pants. He quickly leaves and finally meets his roommate and future BETA brother Bobby. Erik is fairly grossed out as Bobby is having sex with his girlfriend right before his eyes whilst cooking bratwurst and engaging Erik in the awkward &quot;gettin&apos; to know you stage.&quot; From there,the boys go through a long list of trials to get into the Beta fraternity; for example getting their asses signed by a stripper and placing a live ostrich in the GEEK fraternity house.It is only after they complete their final task which involves stealing something from the GEEK house that Edgar,the GEEKs president,challenges the BETAs to the Greek olympiad. The loser,as a result,will give up their charter and be evicted from their house. It is revealed beforehand by Rock,Dwight&apos;s former nemesis,that due to an altercation between Edgar and a sheep,Rock&apos;s entire fraternity was kicked off campus; although Dwight is somewhat hesitant,Rock states that what they had was a rivalry and that &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; When the BETAS and GEEKs reach the final challenge,they use Edgar&apos;s fetish for sheep against him,which ultimately costs him and his house the tournament. The BETAS win and Mr. Levinstein,as the officiate,hands over the golden hammer to Dwight,who,as he accepts it,says,&quot;Betas for life!&quot; Afterward,the BETAS having moved into their new mansion,courtesy of the GEEKs,and hold a massive toga party,where Cooze,much to his relief,finally sleeps with Denise and all suspicions of her being a man are gone. As the morning comes,BETA president Wesley wakes up finally believing that his curse as the blackout menace is over,only to hear the toilet flush and is confronted with the female bodybuilder formerly of the GEEK house.</Plot>

        <Plot>Erik Stifler (John White) has a difficult time living up to his family name. He is Steve and Matt Stifler&apos;s cousin. He is perhaps the only Stifler about to graduate from high school as a virgin. The film opens with Erik feigning illness so that he can stay home and masturbate. Unfortunately,just as he is about to ejaculate,his parents and grandmother unexpectedly walk into the door and are hit with Erik&apos;s semen,after which his grandmother dies of a heart attack. Erik&apos;s dad later surmises that,as a Stifler,his son should be out having sex instead of masturbating. Erik&apos;s girlfriend of two years,Tracy (Jessy Schram),loves him,but is not ready for intercourse. Tracy decides to have sex,their first attempt goes horribly wrong,and she backs out of trying again.Erik&apos;s friends Cooze (Jake Siegel) and Ryan (Ross Thomas) plan a road trip to visit Erik&apos;s cousin Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) in Michigan during an event known as the Naked Mile. Tracy sees this as an opportunity to give Erik a &quot;guilt free weekend pass,&quot; hoping that he can quench his lust and get sex out of his system since she is not ready.Erik and his friends arrive on campus and witness an over-the-top drinking contest where Dwight is crowned a campus champion,lose a rough game of football against a bitter rival fraternity composed almost entirely of midgets,and end up in a brawl with those same midgets on several occasions. This rivalry comes to a head when the midget fraternity attacks Dwight,landing him in the hospital. Dwight is back in full form later that evening when it is time for the Naked Mile run.Erik meets a college girl with a fetish for virgin boys and as they steal a kiss,a news crew captures the moment. Watching the news report about the Naked Mile back at home,Tracy is upset and feels guilty that she allowed Erik the free pass. Her friends convince her to also lose her virginity before he gets back. Later that evening Erik realizes that he loves Tracy and rushes back to see his girlfriend. When he gets to her house,Tracy&apos;s dad says she is at a party and Erik arrives at the party just as Tracy has headed upstairs,presumably to lose her virginity to her ex-boyfriend. Erik loudly pounds on the closed bedroom door,proclaiming his love for her. However,Tracy was not in the room because she had decided that she couldn&apos;t go through with her plans.Later that evening,Tracy and Erik decide that they should be each others&apos; first. They make love that night. When Erik returns to the college to pick up his friends the next morning,each boy shares stories of his experiences from the night before. The three friends drive back to East Great Falls.During the post-Naked Mile party,Dwight spots Vicky (Winkler),the girlfriend of Rock (Prentice),the leader of the midget fraternity,and both have sex. Later,Dwight sent a DVD to Rock that reads,&quot;Payback&apos;s a bitch.&quot; It reveals both Dwight and Vicky having sex,as Rock yells out,&quot;Stifler!&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries,then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes,most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens,and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City,sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce,a Wall Street financial institution,are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux),Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas),David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says &quot;This is a chick&apos;s restaurant. Why aren&apos;t we at Dorsia?&quot; McDermott replies &quot;Because Bateman won&apos;t give the maitre d&apos; head.&quot; Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant,including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there&apos;s no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account,which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. &quot;Jesus,McDermott,what does that have to do with anything?&quot; says Patrick. &quot;I&apos;ve seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah.&quot; Bateman rebukes him. &quot;Not a menorah. A dreidel,you spin a dreidel.&quot; McDermott replies &quot;Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?&quot; &quot;No,just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.&quot; &quot;Oh I forgot. Bateman&apos;s dating someone from the ACLU!&quot; Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks &quot;Speaking of reasonable,only $570.&quot; They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub,Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag,who lets them inside. As some 80&apos;s pop music plays from overhead,the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket,but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays,and then when she&apos;s out of earshot,he says &quot;You&apos;re a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death,then play around with your blood.&quot; He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman&apos;s apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white,with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated,but looks expensive. &quot;I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street,on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I&apos;m 27 years old.&quot; He describes his diet and exercise routine,and his meticulous daily grooming rituals,which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. &quot;There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,&quot; he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. &quot;Some kind of abstraction. But there is no &apos;real me&apos;. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze,and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours,and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable,I simply am not there.&quot;Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York,the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office,Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says &quot;Hey Hamilton. Nice tan.&quot; Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary,Jean (Chloe Sevigny),to his office door. She&apos;s dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. &quot;Aerobics class,sorry. Any messages?&quot; She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled,but she doesn&apos;t know what he cancelled or why. &quot;I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club.&quot; She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. &quot;What should I say?&quot; &quot;Just say no.&quot; He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch,as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. &quot;Something romantic?&quot; &quot;No,silly. Forget it. I&apos;ll make them. Just get me a mineral water.&quot; She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her,he tells her not to wear that outfit. &quot;Wear a dress or a skirt. You&apos;re prettier than that.&quot; The phone starts ringing,and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn&apos;t there. &quot;And high heels.&quot; She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown.

He says he can&apos;t take the time off work to get married. &quot;Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like,silly. You hate that job anyway,I don&apos;t see why you don&apos;t just quit.&quot; &quot;Because... I want... to fit... IN.&quot; The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. &quot;I&apos;m on the verge of tears as we arrive,since I&apos;m positive we won&apos;t have a decent table. But we do,and relief washes over me,in an awesome wave.&quot; Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. &quot;This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash,&quot; says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks,and then starts kissing her neck,slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi,he remarks &quot;I&apos;m fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know.&quot; Bateman doesn&apos;t care because he&apos;s also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson,her best friend. &quot;She&apos;s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs,tonight I believe it&apos;s Xanax.&quot; She&apos;s also engaged to Luis Carruthers,&quot;the biggest doofus in the business.&quot; Courtney and Luis are seated beside him,and Courtney,slurring her words,asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. &quot;Yes. I read that,&quot; says Luis. &quot;Oh who gives a rat&apos;s ass,&quot; says Bryce. &quot;That affects us,&quot; says Vanden. &quot;What about the massacres in Sri Lanka,honey? Don&apos;t you know that the Sikhs are killing like,tons of Israelis over there?&quot; Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid,nuclear arms,terrorism,and world hunger. &quot;We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless,and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights,while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly,we have to promote general social concern,and less materialism in young people.&quot; Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. &quot;Patrick,how thought-provoking,&quot; Luis says,feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It&apos;s nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM machine. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says &quot;hello&quot;. She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day,Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can&apos;t bleach that type of sheet,and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can&apos;t understand. &quot;Lady,if you don&apos;t shut your fucking mouth,I will kill you.&quot; She is shocked,but still won&apos;t speak English. &quot;I can&apos;t understand you! You&apos;re a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!&quot; A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. &quot;It&apos;s so silly to come all the way up here,&quot; she says,&quot;but they really are the best.&quot; &quot;Then why can&apos;t they get these stains out?&quot; he says,showing her the sheets. &quot;Can you get through to them? I&apos;m getting nowhere.&quot; &quot;What are those?&quot; she says,looking wide-eyed at the stains. &quot;Uh,well it&apos;s cranberry juice. Cran-apple.&quot; She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes,and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he&apos;s booked solid. &quot;What about Saturday?&quot; &quot;Next Saturday? Can&apos;t. Matinee of Les Miz.&quot; He promises to call her,and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear,on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. &quot;You&apos;re dating Luis,he&apos;s in Arizona. You&apos;re fucking me and we haven&apos;t made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?&quot; She says she&apos;s waiting for Luis to call. &quot;Pumpkin you&apos;re dating an asshole. Pumpkin you&apos;re dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you&apos;re dating a tumbling,tumbling dickweed.&quot; She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner,and when she says no,he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant,and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone,then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo,Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day,while she is almost passing out from her medication. &quot;Is that Donald Trump&apos;s car?&quot; he asks,looking out the window. Patrick&apos;s face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium,or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. &quot;I just want a child,&quot; she says,absently looking out the window. &quot;Just two... perfect... children.&quot;At the restaurant,she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. &quot;Are we here?&quot; she asks sleepily. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says,sitting down. &quot;This is Dorsia?&quot; &quot;Yes dear,&quot; he says,opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she&apos;s going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. &quot;New York Matinee called it a &apos;playful but mysterious little dish. You&apos;ll love it.&quot; He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him,and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&amp;P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. &quot;Dorsia,how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?&quot; &quot;Lucky I guess,&quot; replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. &quot;Valentino Couture?&quot; &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Luis tries to touch it,but Patrick slaps his hand away. &quot;Your compliment was sufficient Luis.&quot; Paul Allen comes up to them. &quot;Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?&quot; Narrating,Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for &quot;this dickhead Marcus Halberstram.&quot; They both work at P&amp;P and do the same exact work,and wear the same glasses and suits. &quot;Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut.&quot; Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia,Marcus&apos; girlfriend. &quot;She&apos;s great,I&apos;m very lucky,&quot; replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in,congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. &quot;Thank you,Baxter.&quot; Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. &quot;Call me.&quot; &quot;How about Friday?&quot; says Bryce. &quot;No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche.&quot; He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he&apos;s lying. Bateman takes out his new business card,which reads &quot;Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President&quot;. &quot;What do you think?&quot; &quot;Very nice,&quot; says McDermott. &quot;I picked them up from the printers yesterday.&quot; &quot;Nice coloring,&quot; says Bryce. &quot;That&apos;s &apos;bone&apos;. And the lettering is something called &apos;silian rail&apos;.&quot; &quot;Cool Bateman. But that&apos;s nothing,&quot; says Van Paten,laying his card down next to Patrick&apos;s. &quot;That is really nice,&quot; says Bryce. &quot;Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?&quot; Van Paten asks Patrick. &quot;Nice,&quot; Patrick says,visibly jealous. &quot;How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?&quot; says Bryce. Biting his nails,Patrick can&apos;t believe Bryce prefers Van Paten&apos;s card. &quot;You ain&apos;t seen nothing yet,&quot; says Bryce,taking out his own card. &quot;Raised lettering,pale nimbus,white.&quot; Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage,Bateman tells him it&apos;s very nice. &quot;Let&apos;s see Paul Allen&apos;s card.&quot; Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room,even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating,Patrick says &quot;Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!&quot; He drops the card on the table. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; asks Luis. &quot;Patrick? You&apos;re sweating.&quot;Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley,a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him,to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. &quot;Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?&quot; He starts taking out some money. &quot;I&apos;m hungry,&quot; says the bum. &quot;It&apos;s cold out too isn&apos;t it? If you&apos;re so hungry,why don&apos;t you get a job?&quot; The bum says he lost his job. &quot;Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking.&quot; He asks him his name,and the bum says his name is Al. &quot;Get a god-damn job,Al! You have a negative attitude. That&apos;s what&apos;s stopping you.&quot; He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he&apos;s a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick&apos;s arm,and Patrick pulls it off,visibly disgusted. &quot;You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?&quot; He laughs,and then apologizes. &quot;I don&apos;t have anything in common with you.&quot; He bends down and opens his briefcase. &quot;Oh thank you mister,thank you. It&apos;s cold out here...&quot; &quot;You know what a fucking loser you are?&quot; Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach,than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick,so he stomps it with his foot,hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick&apos;s face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later,another Asian woman gives him a manicure. &quot;I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single,clear,identifiable emotion,except for greed,and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me,and I don&apos;t know why.&quot; He is lying in a tanning bed now. &quot;My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.&quot;A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. &apos;Deck The Halls&apos; is playing in the background. Patrick takes one,scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. &quot;Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas,&quot; says Patrick. &quot;Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?&quot; He points to Paul Allen across the room. &quot;Of course. Who else?&quot; Evelyn comes up to them. &quot;Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You&apos;re late honey.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve been here the entire time,you just didn&apos;t see me.&quot; A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick&apos;s head without him noticing. &quot;Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says &apos;hello Patrick&apos;&quot;,she says in a childish voice. &quot;What is it?&quot; Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. &quot;It&apos;s a little baby piggy-wiggy,isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don&apos;t you? Don&apos;t you?&quot; Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. &quot;Stop scowling Patrick. You&apos;re such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don&apos;t say breast implants again.&quot; Ignoring her,he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. &apos;Joy to the World&apos; is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. &quot;Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas,how&apos;ve you been. Workaholic I suppose?&quot; He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell&apos;s bar,and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. &quot;Cecilia would adore it.&quot; &quot;Then let&apos;s do it,Marcus.&quot; Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party,and then walks away. &quot;Why is he calling you Marcus?&quot; asks Evelyn. Ignoring this,Patrick says &quot;Mistletoe alert!&quot;,and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated,and he is arguing with a waiter. &quot;I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo,which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant,which is,by the way,almost completely empty.&quot; Patrick ignores this and orders a J&amp;B straight and a Corona. The waiter,who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck,starts to list the specials,but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. &quot;Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?&quot; &quot;Not if you want to keep your spleen,&quot; says Patrick. The waiter leaves. &quot;This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot,very hot,&quot; Paul comments sarcastically. &quot;The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here,&quot; replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. &quot;I&apos;m a child of divorce,give me a break. I see they&apos;ve omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o.&quot; Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. &quot;Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?&quot; Patrick says,looking behind him. &quot;Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?&quot; He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. &quot;Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I&apos;d have to kill ya!&quot; He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says &quot;I like to dissect girls. Did you know I&apos;m utterly insane?&quot; Paul doesn&apos;t seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon,Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. &quot;You should look into it.&quot; Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. &quot;I think she&apos;s having dinner with Evelyn Williams.&quot; &quot;Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman,what a dork!&quot; Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. &quot;Another martini Paul?&quot;Patrick&apos;s apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. &quot;Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?&quot; &quot;They&apos;re OK,&quot; says Paul. Patrick continues &quot;Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes,but when &apos;Sports&apos; came out in &apos;83,I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically.&quot; He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. &quot;The whole album has a clear crisp sound,and a new sheen of consummate professionalism,that really gives the songs a big boost!&quot; He takes a valium,washes it down,looks at himself in the mirror,and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards,he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello,but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. &quot;Hey Halberstram,&quot; says Paul. &quot;Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?&quot; He laughs. &quot;No Allen.&quot; &quot;Is that a raincoat?&quot; &quot;Yes it is!&quot; He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song &apos;Hip to Be Square&apos; starts playing. &quot;In &apos;87,Huey released this,Fore,their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is &apos;Hip to Be Square&apos;.&quot; He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. &quot;The song is so catchy,most people probably don&apos;t listen to the lyrics,but they should,because it&apos;s not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends,it&apos;s also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!&quot; Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming,he swings it into Paul&apos;s head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor,pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells &quot;Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!&quot; He swings it down again,and again,screaming,decapitating him. &quot;You... fucking... bastard!&quot; He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. &apos;Hip to Be Square&apos; continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him,and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside,and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It&apos;s Luis. &quot;Patrick. Is that you?&quot; &quot;No Luis. It&apos;s not me. You&apos;re mistaken.&quot; He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. &quot;We&apos;re going to Nell&apos;s. Gwendolyn&apos;s father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?&quot; He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. &quot;Jean-Paul Gauthier.&quot; Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later,he arrives at Paul&apos;s apartment. &quot;I almost panic when I realize that Paul&apos;s place overlooks the park,and is obviously more expensive than mine.&quot; He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. &quot;It&apos;s time for Paul to take a little trip.&quot; He throws some clothes in a suitcase,and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul&apos;s voice,he records &quot;It&apos;s Paul. I&apos;ve been called away to London for a few days. Meredith,I&apos;ll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista,baby.&quot; He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day,Patrick listens to the song &apos;The Lady in Red&apos; by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there&apos;s someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Detective Donald Kimball.&quot; He looks through the office window. &quot;Tell him I&apos;m at lunch.&quot; &quot;Patrick,it&apos;s only 10:30. I think he knows you&apos;re here.&quot; &quot;Send him in,I guess,&quot; he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone,giving him advice on clothes and salons. &quot;Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I&apos;ve gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh,just joking. No,don&apos;t tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it.&quot; He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. &quot;No I&apos;m sorry,I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?&quot; Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. &quot;Mulling over business problems,examining opportunities,exchanging rumors,spreading gossip.&quot; They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. &quot;So,what&apos;s the topic of discussion?&quot; Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. &quot;I just have some basic questions.&quot; Patrick offers him coffee,which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water,which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. &quot;It&apos;s no problem.&quot; He asks what the topic of discussion is again,and Kimball repeats he&apos;s investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle,and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn&apos;t heard anything. &quot;I think his family wants this kept quiet.&quot; &quot;Understandable. Lime?&quot; offers Bateman. Kimball insists he&apos;s ok. He asks Patrick his age,where he went to school,and his address,the American Gardens building,which Kimball says is very nice. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. &quot;I&apos;m at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing.&quot; Kimball asks him what he means. &quot;Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.&quot; Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. &quot;I hope I&apos;m not being cross-examined here.&quot; &quot;You feel like that?&quot; &quot;No. Not really.&quot; Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. &quot;He had a yacht?&quot; &quot;No,he just hung out there.&quot; &quot;And where did he go to school?&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t you know this?&quot; &quot;I just wanted to know if you know.&quot; Patrick tells him St. Paul&apos;s,then says he just wants to help. &quot;I understand.&quot; Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine,and that Meredith doesn&apos;t think he went to London. &quot;Has anyone seen him in London?&quot; &quot;Actually,yes. But I&apos;m having a hard time getting actual verification.&quot; He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet,but Kimball says no. &quot;Basically,no-one&apos;s seen or heard anything. It&apos;s just strange. One day someone&apos;s walking around,going to work,alive,and then...&quot; &quot;Nothing.&quot; &quot;People just disappear,&quot; says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says &quot;The earth just... opens up and swallows them.&quot; &quot;Eerie. Really eerie.&quot; Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. &quot;The Four Seasons? Isn&apos;t that a little far up town? I mean,aren&apos;t you going to be late?&quot; &quot;No,there&apos;s one down here.&quot; Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything,and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat,a hooker,stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she&apos;s been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen you around here,&quot; he tells her. &quot;Well you just haven&apos;t been looking.&quot; &quot;Would you like to see my apartment?&quot; She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. &quot;I&apos;m not supposed to,but I can make an exception,&quot; she says,taking the money. &quot;Do you take a credit card? Just joking.&quot; He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. &quot;I&apos;d like a girl,early 20&apos;s,blonde,who does couples. And I really can&apos;t stress blonde enough. Blonde.&quot; He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen,and that he&apos;s going to call her Christie. &quot;You&apos;ll respond only to Christie,is that clear?&quot; She nods.Patrick&apos;s apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub,where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. &quot;That&apos;s a very fine chardonnay you&apos;re drinking.&quot; The song &apos;If You Don&apos;t Know Me by Now&apos; is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. &quot;I want you to clean your vagina,&quot; he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. &quot;From behind. Get on your knees.&quot; He tells her she has a nice body,playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It&apos;s the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe,then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl,and takes her coat. &quot;I&apos;m Paul. Not quite blonde,are you? More like dirty blonde. I&apos;m going to call you Sabrina. I&apos;m Paul Allen.&quot; He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no,lewdly. &quot;Well,I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?&quot; Sabrina shakes her head,and Patrick clenches his jaw. &quot;You have a really nice place here Paul,&quot; says Christie. &quot;How much did you pay for it?&quot; &quot;Well actually Christie,that&apos;s none of your business. But I can assure you,it certainly wasn&apos;t cheap.&quot; Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. &quot;No! No smoking in here.&quot; He offers them chocolate truffles. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get you drunk,but uh,that&apos;s a very fine chardonnay you&apos;re not drinking.&quot; He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. &quot;I&apos;ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album,&apos;Duke&apos;. Before that,I really didn&apos;t understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin&apos;s presence became more apparent.&quot; He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom,invitingly. &quot;I think Invisible Touch is the group&apos;s undisputed masterpiece.&quot; The girls follow him into the bedroom. &quot;It&apos;s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.&quot; He tells Christie to take off the robe,which she does. &quot;Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument,&quot; he says,setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. &quot;In terms of lyrical craftsmanship,and sheer songwriting,this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina,why don&apos;t you dance a little? Take the lyrics to &apos;Land of Confusion&apos;. In this song,Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. &apos;In Too Deep&apos; is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,&quot; he continues,wrapping a scarf around Christie&apos;s neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. &quot;About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I&apos;ve heard in rock.&quot; He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. &quot;Christie,get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin&apos;s solo career seems to be more commercial,and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like &apos;In the Air Tonight&apos; and &apos;Against All Odds&apos;. Sabrina,don&apos;t just stare at it,eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word &apos;artist&apos;.&quot; He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. &quot;This is &apos;Sussudio&apos;,a great,great song. A personal favorite.&quot; He walks back to the bedroom,unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex,then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie&apos;s arm touches his. &quot;Don&apos;t touch the watch.&quot; He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors,carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. &quot;Can we go now?&quot; asks Christie. &quot;We&apos;re not through yet.&quot;Some time later,he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina&apos;s nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott,Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them,discussing women. &quot;If they have a good personality and they are not great looking,who fucking cares?&quot; says McDermott. &quot;Well let&apos;s just say hypothetically,what if they have a good personality?&quot; replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence,and then all three men burst out laughing. &quot;There are no girls with good personalities!&quot; they say in unison,high-fiving each other. Van Paten says &quot;A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things,and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.&quot; McDermott continues: &quot;The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented,though god knows what the fuck that means,are ugly chicks.&quot; Van Paten agrees. &quot;And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.&quot; Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: &quot;Ed Gein? Maitre d&apos; at Canal Bar?&quot; &quot;No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50&apos;s.&quot; &quot;What did Ed say?&quot; &quot;He said &apos;When I see a pretty girl walking down the street,I think two things. One part wants me to take her out,talk to her,be real nice and sweet and treat her right.&apos;&quot; McDermott: &quot;And what did the other part of him think?&quot; &quot;What her head would look like on a stick!&quot; Bateman laughs heartily,but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. &quot;Is that all you ever have to contribute?&quot; snaps Bateman. &quot;Fucking dinner?&quot; McDermott tells him to cheer up. &quot;What&apos;s the matter? No shiatsu this morning?&quot; Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. &quot;Do that again and you&apos;ll draw back a stub.&quot; McDermott tells him &quot;Hang on there little buddy,&quot; but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves,he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking,he slowly puts his fingers around Luis&apos; neck. Luis turns around,looks at Patrick&apos;s hands,takes off one of his gloves,and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. &quot;God. Patrick,why here?&quot; Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can&apos;t bring himself to kill Luis. &quot;I&apos;ve seen you looking at me. I&apos;ve noticed your... hot body,&quot; Luis says,rubbing a finger over Patrick&apos;s mouth. &quot;Don&apos;t be shy. You can&apos;t imagine how long I&apos;ve wanted this,ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie...&quot; Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands,with his gloves still on. He looks like he&apos;s about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. &quot;I want you. I want you too!&quot; Patrick starts walking towards the door. &quot;Patrick?&quot; &quot;WHAT IS IT?&quot; he yells. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve got to return some videotapes.&quot;He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs,he sees Luis make a &apos;call me&apos; gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean&apos;s desk,talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. &quot;I&apos;ve been wanting to talk with you,come into my office,&quot; Patrick says,shaking his hand. &quot;Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?&quot;Inside his office. &quot;Do you remember where you were the night of Paul&apos;s disappearance?&quot; asks Kimball. &quot;Which was on the 20th of December.&quot; &quot;God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes.&quot; He looks at his datebook. &quot;I had a date with a girl named Veronica.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s not what I&apos;ve got,&quot; says Kimball. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;That&apos;s not the information I&apos;ve received.&quot; &quot;What information have you received? I could be wrong.&quot; &quot;When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?&quot; &quot;We&apos;d gone to a new musical called &apos;Oh Africa,Brave Africa&apos;. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I&apos;ve been informative. Long day. I&apos;m a bit scattered.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so,when I&apos;ve sorted out all of this information?&quot; Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. &quot;Absolutely. I&apos;m with you on that one.&quot; Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. &quot;Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?&quot; Patrick is stunned,and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. &quot;Never. I mean I don&apos;t really like singers.&quot; &quot;Not a big music fan,huh?&quot; &quot;No I like music,just they&apos;re... Huey&apos;s too black sounding for me.&quot; &quot;To each his own.&quot; Kimball closes his briefcase. &quot;So,lunch next week?&quot; &quot;I&apos;ll be there.&quot;Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms,then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself,putting it on Courtney&apos;s lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. &quot;Will you call me before Easter?&quot; she asks. &quot;Maybe.&quot; &quot;What are you doing tonight?&quot; &quot;Dinner at uh,River Cafe.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s nice,&quot; she says,lighting a cigarette. &quot;I never knew you smoked.&quot; &quot;You never noticed. Listen,Patrick,can we talk?&quot; &quot;You look... marvelous. There&apos;s nothing to say,&quot; he says,shutting her out. &quot;You&apos;re going to marry Luis.&quot; &quot;Isn&apos;t that special... Patrick? If I don&apos;t see you before Easter,have a nice one okay?&quot; she asks,with a hint of depression in her voice. &quot;You too.&quot; He starts to leave. &quot;Patrick?&quot; &quot;Yeah?&quot; &quot;Nothing...&quot; He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song &apos;Pump up the Volume&apos; is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. &quot;There&apos;s this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected,you can catch anything. Alzheimer&apos;s,muscular dystrophy,hemophilia,leukemia,diabetes,dyslexia!&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not sure but I don&apos;t think dyslexia is a disease,&quot; says Bateman. &quot;But who knows? They don&apos;t know that. Prove it.&quot; Bryce snorts some white powder. &quot;Oh God. It&apos;s a fucking milligram of sweetener.&quot; Patrick sniffs some. &quot;I want to get high off this,not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s definitely weak,but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we&apos;ll be okay,&quot; says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. &quot;Could you keep it down? I&apos;m trying to do drugs!&quot; &quot;Fuck you!&quot; says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. &quot;We&apos;ll do it anyway.&quot; &quot;That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it&apos;s okay!&quot; &quot;Fuck you!&quot; says the man. &quot;Fuck YOU!&quot; says Bryce. &quot;Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let&apos;s do it.&quot;A club balcony. The song &apos;What&apos;s On Your Mind&apos; is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. &quot;He&apos;s the one behind Glasnost.&quot; Bryce makes a &apos;he went to get cocaine&apos; gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. &quot;I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re not confused are you?&quot; asks Bryce. &quot;No,not really.&quot; Another woman says &quot;Gorbachev is NOT downstairs.&quot; &quot;Karen&apos;s right,Gorbachev is not down stairs. He&apos;s at Tunnel.&quot; Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. &quot;So what do you do?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m into uh,well murders and executions mostly.&quot; &quot;Do you like it?&quot; &quot;Well that depends,why?&quot; &quot;Well most guys I know,who work in mergers and acquisitions,really don&apos;t like it.&quot; He asks her where she works out.On the street,Patrick and the girl are talking. &quot;You think I&apos;m dumb don&apos;t you. You think all models are dumb.&quot; &quot;No. I really don&apos;t.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s okay. I don&apos;t mind. There&apos;s something sweet about you.&quot; They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door,and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly,wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. &quot;Doin&apos; the crossword?&quot; she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either &apos;meat&apos; or &apos;bones&apos;. She asks him if he needs any help,but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door,he says &quot;Jean,would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is,if you&apos;re not doing anything.&quot; She says she doesn&apos;t have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. &quot;Well! Isn&apos;t this a coincidence. Listen,where should we go?&quot; She says she doesn&apos;t care where. &quot;How about anywhere you want?&quot; he tells her. &quot;I don&apos;t know Patrick,I can&apos;t make this decision.&quot; &quot;Come on!&quot; he says,chuckling and pointing his pen at her. &quot;Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want,just say it,I can get us in anywhere.&quot; She thinks for a minute. &quot;How about...&quot; Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. &quot;Dorsia?&quot; Patrick looks up. &quot;So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know,we&apos;ll go wherever you want to go.&quot; &quot;Dorsia is fine.&quot; He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. &quot;Dorsia,yes?&quot; says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at,oh,say nine o&apos;clock?&quot; &quot;We&apos;re totally booked.&quot; &quot;Really? That&apos;s great.&quot; &quot;No I said we are totally booked!&quot; &quot;Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!&quot; He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. &quot;Yeah?&quot; he asks,taking off his sunglasses. &quot;You&apos;re... dressed okay.&quot; &quot;You didn&apos;t give a name.&quot; &quot;They know me,&quot; he lies. &quot;Why don&apos;t you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?&quot; She smiles and starts to leave. &quot;And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.&quot;Jean looks out the window of Patrick&apos;s place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She&apos;s dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. &quot;Patrick it&apos;s so elegant. What a wonderful view.&quot; Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. &quot;Jean,sorbet?&quot; &quot;Thanks Patrick. I&apos;d love some.&quot; He gives it to her. &quot;Do you want a bite?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m on a diet,but thank you,&quot; he says. &quot;No need to lose any weight. You&apos;re kidding right? You look great,&quot; she tells him. &quot;Very fit.&quot; &quot;You can always be thinner... look better.&quot; &quot;Well,maybe we shouldn&apos;t go out to dinner. I don&apos;t want to ruin your willpower.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s alright. I&apos;m not very good at controlling it anyway.&quot; He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. &quot;So,what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don&apos;t tell me you enjoy working with children.&quot; She tells him she&apos;d like to travel and maybe go back to school. &quot;I don&apos;t really know. I&apos;m at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities.&quot; Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. &quot;I&apos;m just so unsure.&quot; He asks her if she has a boyfriend. &quot;No,not really.&quot; &quot;Interesting.&quot; &quot;Are you seeing anyone? I mean,seriously?&quot; she asks. &quot;Maybe. I don&apos;t know. Not really,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;Jean,do you feel,fulfilled? I mean,in your life?&quot; &quot;I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I&apos;ve really begun to think about changing myself,developing and growing.&quot; Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. &quot;Growing. I&apos;m glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy&apos;s first dog,a collie,was named Lassie?&quot; he laughs. &quot;Who&apos;s Ted Bundy?&quot; &quot;Forget it.&quot; &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;Duct tape. I need it for... taping something.&quot; &quot;Patrick,have you ever wanted to make someone happy?&quot; She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. &quot;No! Put it in the carton!&quot; &quot;Sorry.&quot; He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. &quot;I&apos;m looking for uh...&quot; He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. &quot;I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.&quot; His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings,and the answering machine picks it up. It&apos;s Evelyn. &quot;Patrick... Patrick! I know you&apos;re there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?&quot; He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. &quot;It&apos;s me. Don&apos;t try to hide. I hope you&apos;re not out there with some number you picked up because you&apos;re MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door.&quot; Jean sips some wine,looking at Patrick as she listens. &quot;Anyway you never called me and you said you would,and I&apos;ll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you,but we&apos;re having dinner with Melania and Taylor,you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we&apos;re meeting at the Cornell club. So I&apos;ll see you tomorrow morning honey!&quot; Patrick winces. &quot;Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye.&quot; She hangs up. Jean says &quot;Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?&quot; He doesn&apos;t answer. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he finally says. &quot;I don&apos;t think I can control myself.&quot; &quot;I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.&quot; She asks him if he wants her to go. &quot;I think if you stay,something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don&apos;t want to get hurt,do you?&quot; &quot;No,I guess not. I don&apos;t want to get bruised.&quot; She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out,she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. &quot;Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.&quot;A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other,eating some beef dishes. &quot;So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?&quot; asks Kimball. &quot;I&apos;m not sure. Uh,I had a shower,and some sorbet?&quot; &quot;I think you&apos;re getting your dates mixed up.&quot; &quot;Well,where do you place Paul that night?&quot; He tells Patrick that according to his datebook,Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram,thought Marcus denied it. &quot;Does Marcus have an alibi?&quot; &quot;Yes. I&apos;ve checked it out,it&apos;s clean. Now,where were you?&quot; &quot;Well,where was Marcus?&quot; &quot;He wasn&apos;t with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott,Fredrick Dibble,Harry Newman,George Butner,and... you.&quot; Patrick looks up. &quot;Oh right,yeah,of course.&quot; Kimball makes a &apos;slipped your mind&apos; gesture. &quot;We had wanted Paul Allen to come,but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.&quot; Kimball says &quot;Personally,I think the guy just went a little nutso,split town for a while,maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing,drinking,whatever. Anyway,I&apos;m pretty sure he&apos;ll turn up sooner or later. I mean,to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn&apos;t that right Patrick?&quot; he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She&apos;s standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure about this,&quot; she tells him. &quot;I had to go to emergency last time.&quot; He promises that this won&apos;t be anything like last time. She says no. &quot;Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You&apos;ll be safe.&quot; He holds out some money. Reluctantly,she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. &quot;Nothing like last time. I promise,&quot; he repeats. &quot;Alright.&quot; He tells her she&apos;s looking great,and asks how she&apos;s been. &quot;I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.&quot; &quot;Lawyers are so complicated,&quot; he says,writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her,waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it,but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again,moving over to let her get back in. &quot;Half now,half later.&quot; He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again,and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. &quot;She&apos;ll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You&apos;ll like her. She&apos;s a very nice girl.&quot;Paul Allen&apos;s apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon,and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. &quot;Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar,didn&apos;t I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar.&quot; She talks on and on in a self-important tone,neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. &quot;It&apos;s not that nice,&quot; he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. &quot;You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number.&quot; &quot;What do you mean? She was a hot number.&quot; &quot;If you had a platinum card she&apos;d give you a blowjob. Listen,this girl worked at a tanning salon,need I say more?&quot; She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. &quot;She&apos;s my... cousin. She&apos;s from... France,&quot; says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she&apos;s calling doesn&apos;t answer. &quot;Elizabeth,it&apos;s 3 in the morning.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s a god damn drug dealer,these are his peak hours.&quot; She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can&apos;t remember where she is. &quot;Paul Allen&apos;s.&quot; &quot;I want the number idiot. Anyway I&apos;m at Paul Norman&apos;s and I&apos;ll try you again later,and if I don&apos;t see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I&apos;m going to sic my hairdresser on you.&quot; She hangs up. &quot;Did you know that guy who disappeared,didn&apos;t he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?&quot; He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. &quot;Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon.&quot; &quot;Listen,&quot; he says. &quot;I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*.&quot; They stare at him. &quot;What&apos;s wrong with that? It&apos;s totally disease-free.&quot; &quot;Patrick you&apos;re a lunatic.&quot; He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. &quot;Let&apos;s not get lewd. I&apos;m in no mood for lewd conversation.&quot; He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. &quot;You&apos;re telling me you&apos;ve never gotten it on with a girl?&quot; he asks Elizabeth. &quot;No. I&apos;m not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?&quot; &quot;Well,you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.&quot; &quot;Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS,Patrick. You&apos;re making me feel weird.&quot;Some time later,the drugs having kicked in,and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully &quot;Did you know that Whitney Houston&apos;s debut LP,called simply &apos;Whitney Houston&apos;,had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?&quot; Elizabeth starts laughing. &quot;You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?&quot; she laughs,falling off the couch. &quot;It&apos;s hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But &apos;The Greatest Love of All&apos; is one of the best,most powerful songs ever written,about self-preservation,dignity,it&apos;s universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it&apos;s not too late to better ourselves.&quot; Elizabeth is still laughing. &quot;Since,Elizabeth,it&apos;s impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others,but we can always empathize with ourselves. It&apos;s an important message,crucial really,and it&apos;s beautifully stated on the album.&quot;All three have sex,Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth&apos;s torso,and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets,and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room,and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open,to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick&apos;s existence finally revealed to her,she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words &apos;DIE YUPPIE SCUM&apos; and the room is covered with blood and feces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead,naked woman. Patrick runs in,covered in Elizabeth&apos;s blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. &quot;Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!&quot; She runs through the living room and out into the hallway,pounding and screaming on neighbours&apos; doors,but to no avail. Patrick runs after her,stark nude,and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap,waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom,he lets go,and the chainsaw falls end over end,finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn&apos;t touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him,asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. &quot;I think Evelyn,that uh,we&apos;ve lost touch.&quot; &quot;Why,what&apos;s wrong?&quot; she asks,waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her,and she mouths &quot;It&apos;s beautiful. I love it.&quot; &quot;My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected,but uh,I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It&apos;s over,it&apos;s all over,&quot; he tells her,scratching a red X over his drawing. &quot;Touchy touchy. I&apos;m sorry I brought up the wedding. Let&apos;s just avoid the issue,alright? Now,are we having coffee?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m fucking serious. It&apos;s fucking over,us,this is no joke,uh,I don&apos;t think we should see each other any more.&quot; &quot;But your friends are my friends,and my friends are your friends. I really don&apos;t think it would work.&quot; She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth,but her stops her. &quot;I know that your friends are my friends,and I&apos;ve thought about that. You can have &apos;em.&quot; She finally understands. &quot;You&apos;re really serious,aren&apos;t you? What about the past? Our past?&quot; &quot;We never really shared one,&quot; he replies. &quot;You&apos;re inhuman.&quot; &quot;No. I&apos;m-I&apos;m in touch with humanity.&quot; She starts crying. &quot;Evelyn I&apos;m sorry,I just uh... you&apos;re not terribly important to me.&quot; She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. &quot;I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes...&quot; &quot;What is it that you want?&quot; she cries. &quot;If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!&quot; he snaps. &quot;Oh God I can&apos;t believe this,&quot; she weeps. &quot;I&apos;m leaving,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve assessed the situation and I&apos;m leaving.&quot; &quot;But where are you going?&quot; &quot;I have to return some videotapes.&quot;Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM machine. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. &quot;Here kitty kitty.&quot; He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: &apos;FEED ME A STRAY CAT&apos;. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM,but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat&apos;s head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. &quot;Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!&quot; He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away,and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car,but every car on the street is locked,and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out,guns drawn. &quot;Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!&quot; He starts to put his hands up,then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover,firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots,and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck,he looks at the gun,then at his watch,and walks away. He breaks into a run,under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. &quot;Burning the midnight oil,Mr. Smith? Don&apos;t forget to sign in,&quot; says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door,back into the lobby,shoots the janitor,then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat,he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman,he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen,signs in,and goes up in the elevator,crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window,then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying,he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. &quot;Harold,it&apos;s Bateman. You&apos;re my lawyer so I think you should know,I&apos;ve killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh,some homeless people maybe 5 or 10,um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany,my old girlfriend,with a nail gun,and some man,some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw,I had to,she almost got away and uh someone else there I can&apos;t remember maybe a model,but she&apos;s dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face,his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell&apos;s Kitchen. I don&apos;t want to leave anything out here. I guess I&apos;ve killed maybe 20 people,maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it,uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even,um...&quot; He almost can&apos;t say it. &quot;I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little.&quot; He starts laughing. &quot;Tonight I,uh,hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!&quot; Crying again. &quot;And I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m gonna get away with it this time. I guess I&apos;ll uh,I mean,ah,I guess I&apos;m a pretty uh,I mean I guess I&apos;m a pretty sick guy.&quot; He&apos;s smiling. &quot;So,if you get back tomorrow,I may show up at Harry&apos;s Bar,so you know,keep your eyes open.&quot; He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen&apos;s place,putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door,he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms,and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans,ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask,stunned. &quot;Are you my 2:00?&quot; asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Can I help you?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m looking for Paul Allen&apos;s place. Doesn&apos;t he live here?&quot; &quot;No he doesn&apos;t. Did you see the ad in the Times?&quot; &quot;No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times.&quot; &quot;There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now.&quot; He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble,and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. &quot;Don&apos;t come back,&quot; she warns.</Plot>

        <Plot>This is the third movie in the American Pie series with Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) getting married. Stifler played by Seann William Scott stole the movie with his tasteless and boorish behavior. Stifler was not invited to the wedding,but he gets an invite when he teaches Jim how to dance. Without Stifler at the wedding,this movie would only be a small comedy. You hater Stifle at the beginning because he is an inconsiderate person with no respect for women; and then you give him a break and begin to like him even after he almost ruins the wedding by killing all the flowers. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)&#x0A;**************************************************************************************************************************************************************&#x0A;The film begins with Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty having dinner,celebrating their college graduation. Jim intends to propose to Michelle,but receives a phone call from his dad,who says he forgot to give Jim the engagement ring and was on his way. As Jim tries to stall,Michelle gets the impression that he wants a public sex act and proceeds to perform oral sex on him under the table. When Mr. Levenstein (Eugene Levy) arrives,Jim tries to hide the fact that he&apos;s being fellated. Not knowing Michelle is under the table,Jim&apos;s dad expresses his excitement at the proposal. Then,after Michelle bumps her head under the table in shock at hearing about the proposal,all chaos ensues as Jim ends up exposed and has to hike his pants up quickly. Saving face,he swallows what&apos;s left of his pride and asks Michelle to marry him. She readily agrees.As planning begins,Jim worries that the wedding will be a disaster. Michelle&apos;s parents hate him after an accidental scene during their engagement party in which Jim appears to be having sex with their two dogs. Michelle&apos;s wedding dress is made by only one designer working for one store,so Jim sets out to find the dress maker for her. They go to Chicago looking for her and Stifler ends up in a gay bar and has a dance-off to make up for his rudeness towards a man who knew the dress maker. Jim can&apos;t dance,but salvation comes in the form of Stifler (Seann William Scott),who took dance lessons. Stifler only teaches Jim to dance on the condition he be allowed to attend the wedding and plan the bachelor party. (Jim and Michelle had planned to leave Stifler in the dark about the whole event,but he found out accidentally after crashing their engagement party.)In the mean time Stifler arranges a bachelor party at Jim&apos;s house except Jim who unknowingly has arranged a &apos;special dinner&apos; for Michelle&apos;s parents before the wedding. The three are then introduced to Fraulein Brandi and Officer Krystal by Mr. Belvedere and then play Bondage and Submissive roles with them. While this is going on,Jim enters the house and Michelle&apos;s parents are badly embarrassed.Michelle&apos;s sister Cadence (January Jones) attends the wedding,and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is quickly attracted to her. Sadly,so is Stifler. Upon hearing that Cadence is hoping to attract a decent guy,Stifler adopts a more meek attitude and acts like Finch,and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy. But when Finch realizes that Cadence is beginning to tire of the intellectual Stifler,Finch acts immature,rude,and perverted: in other words,like Stifler. Cadence begins to catch on that her two suitors are acting like each other,so the question of who she&apos;ll choose becomes more complicated. Stifler unintentionally kills the flowers the night before the wedding,and actually feels bad about it,prompting him to bring in the football team he coaches to set up the entire room with new flowers. It is also implied that Stifler slept with the older woman who made the flowers,as a way of bribing her to remake them all. Cadence chooses Stifler,and Finch admits that Stifler was probably better for her anyway. Stifler,angry that he can&apos;t hate Finch after such a noble remark,calls Finch a &quot;dick&quot; and tells him &quot;I fucking hate not hating you!&quot;. He is quickly reminded by Finch that &quot;I did fuck your mom...Twice&quot;The film features several trademark infamous scenes as in the first two films. Stifler is charged with taking care of the bride&apos;s wedding ring,but he accidentally feeds it to a dog. Waiting for the dog to defecate,Stifler retrieves the ring in a chocolate wrapper and goes to wash it,but is intercepted by Michelle&apos;s mother. Mistaking it for a truffle,Michelle&apos;s mother attempts to eat it,giving Stifler no other choice but to eat it himself to save face. Later,during the ceremony,Stifler takes a moment to quickly sniff the ring before handing it to Jim.Michelle and Jim eventually get married. At the reception,they dance while Stifler dances with Cadence. Finch is sitting by himself when Stifler&apos;s mom (Jennifer Coolidge) arrives. They tell each other they are over each other. At the end of the movie it shows Stifler&apos;s mom and Finch in the tub having sex. The two men delegated to watch Jim&apos;s grandma (John Cho and Justin Isfield),who are also the ushers for the wedding,are watching in awe from the window as Finch goes under the bubbles to perform oral sex on her. Stiffler also ends up accidentally having sex with Jim&apos;s grandmother when he goes to a closet to have sex with Cadence and the grandmother is thrown into the closet.</Plot>

        <Plot>******* WARNING : The below contents may contain SPOILERS *******While fixing a satellite in orbit,the Space Shuttle Atlantis is destroyed by a meteor shower,killing the entire crew. Meteorites then bombard New York City and several other parts of the world,and NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas,traveling at 22,000 miles per hour,will collide with Earth in 18 days,effectively destroying the planet. The scientists at NASA - in cooperation with the Russian,Japanese and other European space agencies - plan to detonate a nuclear bomb at a precise point under the asteroid&apos;s surface which will split it in two,and cause it to miss the Earth. However,the bombs must be planted at least 800 feet below the surface within eight hours of landing,and no later than four hours before the Earth impact. The mission is not revealed to the public,fearing panic.NASA locates Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis),because he could help them drill a hole on the asteroid. When invited to NASA,Harry brings his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) to keep her away from A.J. (Ben Affleck),a young,rambunctious member of his crew who,he has just discovered,has been sleeping with her. This disappoints and infuriates Harry because he did not want his daughter to marry an oil driller like himself or remain in the blue collar life. Head of NASA Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) informs Harry of the dire situation. Harry recognizes that he and his crew must accompany the astronauts to ensure the job is done properly. After Harry&apos;s crew (Jayotis &quot;Bear&quot; Kurleenbear,Max Lennert,Rockhound,Oscar Choice,Charles &quot;Chick&quot; Chapple and some others) is collected and NASA acquiesces to their demands,they are put through a 12-day training program and outfit a drilling rig with the proper equipment.After a meteorite strikes Shanghai,China,destroying the city and causing a tsunami,the incoming asteroid and pending mission are revealed to the world. Two military shuttles,Freedom and Independence,are launched and dock at a Russian space station (crewed by Lev Andropov) to refuel with liquid oxygen propellant. A.J. encounters a problem stopping the pumps after the ships&apos; tanks are full and the station explodes. The crews and Lev Andropov escape. Later,the two shuttles perform a high G-force powered slingshot procedure around the Moon,traveling at 22,500 miles per hour to intercept the asteroid.As they enter the asteroid&apos;s wake,the Independence is struck by debris and crash-lands on the asteroid,killing most of its crew,including Oscar Choice,Freddie Noonan and the Independence pilots. AJ,Lev and Bear survive. The Freedom lands on the surface but misses the target landing zone,arriving on an area of hard iron which will be difficult to drill through. The Freedom team tries to drill but suffers several setbacks and losses due to unexpected conditions.After losing communication with Earth,the mission is put on hold,as the bomb&apos;s timer is activated by orders from the United States President to ensure the mission succeeds. However,a surface explosion would not be sufficient to divert the asteroid. Harry convinces Colonel Sharp to de-activate the bomb and help them attempt to finish the job. With just 250 feet left to drill,their drilling machine is blasted off the asteroid by a gas vent killing Max in the process. When the crew radio report to NASA that the mission has failed,worldwide panic ensues as humanity braces for the end of the world. A massive meteoroid then strikes Paris,destroying most of the city.&#x0A;The Freedom crew learns that the other team managed to survive the crash thanks to Lev Andropov and A.J. and have driven the second drilling machine to the site. Harry puts A.J. in charge of finishing the drilling and they successfully drill to the necessary depth. The team lowers the nuclear bomb into the hole,but are caught in a rockstorm. The storm kills crew member Gruber and damages the remote on the bomb,rendering remote detonation useless. With 18 minutes left,Truman tells the team that someone must stay behind to detonate the bomb. A.J. is chosen after drawing straws,but Harry disables A.J.&apos;s air supply and takes his place. As the shuttle departs,Harry sends a message to his daughter,giving his full support for her to marry A.J.&#x0A;Harry detonates the bomb exactly at the deadline,causing the asteroid to split in two and miss the Earth by 400 miles,at the cost of his own life. The remaining crews of Freedom and Independence return to Earth as heroes. A.J. reunites with Grace while the others are met by their loved ones. Grace and A.J. soon marry,while Harry and the other lost crew members are memorialized.</Plot>

        <Plot>After a brief flashback to Evil Dead II,which explains the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and how Ash got to where he is,Ash lands in Medieval England,where he is almost immediately captured by Lord Arthur&apos;s men,who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry,with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry,his gun and chainsaw confiscated,and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he fights off a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur&apos;s Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free (since Henry stood up for him,and swore he did not know who Ash was),Ash is celebrated as a hero,and also grows attracted to the sister of one of Arthur&apos;s fallen knights,Sheila.According to the Wise Man,the only way Ash can return to his time is to retrieve the Necronomicon. After bidding goodbye to Sheila,Ash starts his search for the Necronomicon. Entering a haunted forest,an unseen force pursues Ash through the woods. Fleeing,Ash ducks into a windmill where he crashes into a mirror. The small reflections of Ash climb out from the shattered mirror and torment him. One of the reflections dives down Ash&apos;s throat and uses his body to become a life-sized copy of Ash,after which Ash kills him and buries him.When he arrives at the Necronomicon&apos;s location,he finds three books instead of one. Ash eventually finds the real one and attempts to say the magic phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;. (The line was taken from the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still). However,forgetting the last word,he tries to trick the book by mumbling the missing word. He then grabs the book from the cradle,and rushes back to the castle,while the dead rise from graves all around. During Ash&apos;s panicked ride back,Ash&apos;s evil copy rises from his grave and unites the Deadites into the Army of Darkness.Despite causing the predicament faced by the Medieval soldiers,Ash initially demands to be returned to his own time. However,Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite,and then transformed into a Deadite. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the skeletal Deadite army. Reluctantly,the people agree to join Ash. Using scientific knowledge from textbooks in the trunk of his 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88,and enlisting the help of Duke Henry,Ash successfully leads the Medieval soldiers to defeat his Deadite clone,Evil Ash,and his Deadite Army,and save Sheila. After this,he is brought back to his own time using a potion made from the Necronomicon.The final scene (See Different versions) begins with Ash back at the S-Mart store,telling a male co-worker (Ted Raimi) all about his adventure back in time,and how he could have been king. After this,a Deadite starts wreaking havoc on the store (it is implied that he again raised the dead by saying the wrong words needed to travel through time),and Ash slays the creature. The film ends with Ash in voice over saying,&quot;Sure,I could have stayed in the past. Could have even been king. But in my own way,I am king.&quot; He then says out loud,while kissing the attractive female co-worker whose life he has just saved,&quot;Hail to the King,baby!&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens to a young George (Jesse James) and his parents Fred (Ray Liotta) and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths). Fred files for bankruptcy and loses everything. Fred tries to instill George with a belief that money is not important.A grown-up George (Johnny Depp) moves to Southern California with his friend &quot;Tuna&quot; (Ethan Suplee) and they plan to earn a living by selling marijuana with the help of an airline stewardess,Barbara Buckley (Franka Potente),and a girlfriend of George who introduces them to her friend/entrepreneur Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens),the main dealer,who also runs a hair salon. With Derek&apos;s help,George and Tuna make a lot of money. Kevin Dulli (Max Perlich),a college student back in Boston who is a friend,visits them and tells them of the enormous demand for pot in Boston. With the help of Barbara,they start bringing the drugs to Boston.As the demand grows,they decide to start buying the drugs directly from Mexico with the help of a few Mexican drug lords. George then proceeds on to Chicago to do business,but is caught trying to import 660 pounds of marijuana and he is sentenced to two years. George skips bail (after trying to plead his innocence by reciting It Ain&apos;t Me Babe) to take care of Barbara,who is suffering from,and eventually succumbs to,cancer.While hiding from the authorities George visits his parents back in Massachusetts. While he is having a heart to heart talk with his father,George&apos;s mother calls the police who come and arrest him.George is now sentenced to twenty-six months in a federal prison in Danbury,Connecticut. His cellmate Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla) has contacts in the cocaine trade in Colombia and convinces George to help him go into business. When George gets out of prison,he violates his parole conditions and heads down to Cartagena,Colombia to meet up with Diego. They meet with Cesar Rosa,to negotiate the terms for smuggling 15 kilograms for &quot;good faith&quot;. As the smuggling operation grows,Diego gets arrested,leaving George to find a way to sell 50 kilos (110 lbs) of blow and get the money in time. He reconnects with Derek in California,and the two successfully sell all of it in 36 hours,amassing a $1.35 million profit. George is then whisked off to Medellin,Colombia,where he finally meets Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) who agrees to go into business with George and Diego. With the help of main middleman Derek,the pair becomes Pablo&apos;s #1 importer. After an altercation with Diego over his &quot;connection&quot;,who happened to be Derek (Diego pressured George to reveal his connection),and a drug-related collapse,George returns home and vows to leave the drug business forevermore,especially as he now has a daughter.All goes well with George&apos;s civilian lifestyle for five years,until his wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) organizes a 38th birthday party for him. Many of his former drug business associates attend,including Derek who reconciles with George after it is revealed that Diego cut him off of their deal. The party is raided by police and George is arrested. Following his conviction,he becomes a fugitive dodging his court date. Meanwhile,his large Panamanian bank accounts have been seized. His wife Mirtha causes him to be arrested while driving one night. He is sent to jail for three years and during that sentence Mirtha gives him the news that she wants a divorce and she wants custody of their nine year old daughter,Kristina Sunshine Jung. On his release he finds himself struggling to keep a relationship with his daughter on good terms.George promises his daughter Kristina (Emma Roberts) a vacation in California and goes into one last deal to garner enough money for the trip. On the deal,he is set up by the FBI and DEA,along with old accomplices,and sentenced to 60 years at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He explains in the end that the sentence did not bother him,nor did the fact that he was betrayed by his accomplices &quot;to save their own asses&quot; bother him. What bothered him was he broke a promise to his daughter,in addition to the emotional damage he caused on those he loved (especially his daughter) and how his ambition exceeded his talent.In prison,his lawyer says that his request for a furlough for George to see his dying father was squashed by his unforgiving mother,who says it would only upset him. He is given a tape recorder to record a final message to his father. In the message,George recounts his memories of working with his father,his run-ins with the law,and how finally,too late,does he realize what his father meant when his said that money is not &quot;real&quot;.The film closes with George being an old man in prison,imagining that his daughter finally comes to visit him and conversing with him. She slowly fades away as a guard calls for George indicating that she is not real and just an illusion. The film concludes with notes indicating that Jung is still in prison,his sentence not to expire until 2015,and his daughter yet to visit him,with the final imagery being a photograph of the actual George Jung.</Plot>

        <Plot>Jason Statham plays Detective Quentin Conners,a rogue cop who&apos;s been suspended from the force for playing a part in the accidental shooting of a woman in a hostage crisis. His partner&apos;s been fired and its funny- but we never meet that partner. At least not until the end of the film. Anyway Snipes and his gang pull a bank robbery and ask specifically for Conners to be the one in charge of negotiations. His superiors take him off suspension but give him a babysitter- rookie Detective Shane Dekker (Phillippe). They head off to the bank where there is a standoff andyou guessed it- a hostage situation! Things end badly and a few hostages die but more importantly Snipes and Company get away. But did they even take anything? Nothing noticeable. This is where the film goes into frenzied,implausible,action mode- as Statham and the super-smart Phillippe go after Snipes,who seems virtually impossible to catch. That&apos;s because he&apos;s Statham&apos;s ex-partner! The two are in on an intricate plot to get rich and flee the country. Conners fakes his own death and while Phillipe is able to foil Snipe&apos;s plans he can&apos;t stop Conners. In the end,he gets away leaving detective Dekker stunned and dumfounded.</Plot>

        <Plot>Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has built the greatest and largest chocolate factory in the world. After some of his workers steal his secret recipes,Willy Wonka kicks his workers out and closes the doors. For 15 years,no one has seen any workers entering or leaving the factory,yet his chocolate candy is still being produced and shipped around the world. One day when Willy Wonka is getting his hair cut,he realizes that he is getting old,and he needs a successor. He comes up with a plan to open his factory and reveal his secrets to five lucky children,who find golden tickets inside Wonka chocolate bars.The golden tickets are sent around the world and soon 4 winners are announced. The first to find a ticket is the greedy Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz). Second is the spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter). Next is the competitive gum-chomping Violet Beauregard (AnnaSophia Robb). Fourth is the chocolate-hating techie Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry). There is one golden ticket left,and the achingly poor Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) finds it. Charlie chooses his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) to accompany him inside the factory,a place his Grandpa Joe once worked before it was closed. The other four children with their parents,and Charlie with Grandpa Joe,enter the factory and begin the tour of a lifetime.The factory is not like your standard factory,but a living factory which mixes chocolate by waterfall,and boasts a river of chocolate that enables the group to tour the factory by boat. They experience the great glass Wonkavator,which can go anywhere in the factory,in any direction,at the touch of a button. During the tour,the group learns that all the work is now being done by the Oompa-Loompa tribe,who are paid in cocoa beans. The factory is indeed fantastic: trees and grass are edible,trained squirrels shell nuts for the chocolate bars,entire meals are contained in a stick of gum,and incredible technology allows chocolate to be sent by television. The four rotten children get to interact with some of Willy Wonka&apos;s fantastic inventions with unfortunate consequences which force them off the tour before it is completed. Charlie is the last child left,and Willy Wonka awards Charlie the greatest prize of all,the keys to the factory,which Charlie refuses. Accepting the prize means living Willy Wonka&apos;s life: cut off from family and the world to devote oneself to the pursuit of chocolate perfection. After some time,Willy Wonka sees that while Charlie may be the right person for the factory,the life that Willy Wonka chose for himself isn&apos;t right for Charlie. He relents and allows Charlie to bring his entire family into the factory with him,and they all live happily ever after.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens on November 16th,2027. A brief newscast reports on the state of the world: women have become infertile and no children have been born for 18 years. Most of the world&apos;s societies have collapsed and in Britain,all foreigners have been declared illegal immigrants and are rounded up by British military forces to be deported. Additionally,the youngest person in the world,Baby Diego,has been murdered,having been a celebrity all his life.The film&apos;s protagonist,Theo Faron,has narrowly escaped being killed when the London coffee shop he frequents is bombed,an act attributed to an underground guerrilla group,the Fishes. Theo is shaken by the incident and leaves work early to visit his friend,Jasper,who lives outside London. Jasper,a former political activist,now lives in seclusion in a well-hidden house with his catatonic wife,Janice,growing variants of cannabis.The next day Theo is captured by The Fishes and is reunited with his former wife,Julian,who leads the group. She and Theo have not seen each other for nearly 20 years after their son,Dylan,died in a flu epidemic. She first tells him that the Fishes were not responsible for the bombing of the cafe the previous day. She also asks for his help in securing transit papers; Theo&apos;s cousin,Nigel,has influence within the government. Theo is able to get the papers but they specifically state that Theo himself must accompany the refugee they are meant for. Theo agrees and he joins Julian,her associate Luke,the refugee Kee and her midwife,Miriam as they drive to the southern coast of England. Along the way,they are attacked in a forested area by a large mob and Julian is killed. As they flee the scene of the attack,they are pulled over by the police. When asked for their papers,Luke kills both policemen. A small funeral is held in the forest for Julian and Luke drives them to a safe house on a farm after finding another car.At the farm,Kee,reveals to Theo that she is about eight months pregnant. She also tells Theo that Julian had told Kee that she could only trust Theo. The Fishes hold a meeting to decide what to do with Kee. They conclude,despite Theo&apos;s objections,that Kee should stay with them until the child is born. Theo thinks the pregnancy should be made public,the Fishes think that the British government would seize both Kee and the baby for their own political ends. Kee agrees to stay in the custody of the Fishes.Later that night,Theo awakens to a commotion outside. Two of the men who attacked the travelers that day have come to the safe house,one of them badly wounded. Theo discovers that the attack on the car and Julian&apos;s murder were both arranged by Luke and the Fishes,who wish to use the baby for their own ends. Theo quietly awakes Kee and Miriam and convinces them to leave with him. They steal a car and narrowly escape the farm. Theo takes them to Jasper&apos;s house. While there,Jasper promises to arrange for Kee to meet a ship called the Tomorrow,a vessel belonging to a group called the Human Project,a collection of scientists based in the Azores off Portugal,and dedicated to restoring human fertility. Jasper arranges for his friend,Sid,to help Kee,Miriam and Theo enter the immigrant camp at Bexhill. From there,they will make arrangements for Kee to slip into the waters near Bexhill to meet the Tomorrow.The Fishes find Jasper&apos;s hidden home,setting off the alarms. Jasper gives Theo his car and gives them an escape route. From a nearby bluff,Theo watches as Jasper refuses to give the Fishes any information and is murdered. Before the Fishes arrival,Jasper had euthanized his wife.Theo drives himself and his charges to a nearby school to rest and wait for Sid. While there,Miriam talks of her past work as a maternity nurse and the onset of female sterilization 18 years prior. Sid arrives,acting very intimidating at first,and takes the fugitives in his truck to Bexhill. As they approach the detention center,Kee goes into labor. When they arrive,Miriam,while trying to protect Kee from the guards,fakes religious mania and is taken off the bus,hooded and detained,however,her fate is not revealed. Theo and Kee manage to enter Bexhill with her pregnancy undetected and meet a woman named Marichka who gives them a room. Right after they reach the room,Kee gives birth to a girl.The next morning they are met by Marichka and Sid,who tells them about an uprising that has taken over Bexhill. The Fishes have broken into the city and the national guard have been called out to restore control. Both Sid and Marichka are also astonished to see the baby. Sid,having seen Theo on television the night before,plans to turn Theo in for a large reward,Theo being a prime suspect from the attack on the road. With Marichka&apos;s help,they escape Sid and find a temporary haven with Marichka&apos;s people. Marichka is also supposed to take them to a boat that will get them to the Tomorrow in Bexhill&apos;s harbor.Theo,Marichka and Kee enter the city &amp; are quickly found by Luke and his cohorts. They take Kee and leave Theo &amp; Marichka to be executed by Patric,one of Luke&apos;s lieutenants. They are able to escape when a skirmish erupts nearby. Theo goes looking for Kee,finding her in a decrepit apartment building which is under fire from the military. Theo finds Kee with Luke,who has joined the battle with the British forces outside. As Theo attempts to take Kee and the baby out,Luke opens fire in Theo&apos;s direction -- Luke is killed a few moments later. As Theo and Kee walk out of the building,everyone who sees the baby stands in awe and the fighting stops,many of them break into prayer. The two walk outside the building and begin to walk away. The fighting resumes. They find their way back to Marichka and the rowboat she&apos;s found for them and float out into Bexhill&apos;s harbor. Marichka refuses to leave with them.The two make it out to a nearby buoy which marks the rendezvous point. As they wait,two jets fly overhead and begin a bombardment of Bexhill. Kee sees blood in the bottom of the boat and panicks,thinking it&apos;s hers. Theo tells her he was hit in the abdomen when Luke shot at him. Theo has just enough time to teach Kee how to burp the baby and she tells him that she&apos;ll name her after Theo&apos;s son,Dylan. Theo loses consciousness just as the Tomorrow arrives. Just before the closing credits roll the sound of children laughing is heard.</Plot>

        <Plot>An aggrieved first term President implicitly (&quot;What I would suggest I cannot suggest&quot;) authorizes a secret military incursion into Columbia after a personal friend of his is killed by men connected to Columbian drug cartels. Jack Ryan,temporarily promoted as Deputy Director of Intelligence at the CIA after Jim Greer is diagnosed with cancer is unintentionally mired in the scheme. He was tasked with securing the funding for the operation from Congress,even specifically promising no troops would be used despite that being (unbeknown to Ryan) the whole point of the operation.The military operation is initially successful,striking at drug refining facilities and shooting down drug running aircraft. After the President orders a large amount of laundered drug money seized,a cartel retaliates by assassinating a Presidential aide (from which Ryan himself narrowly escapes) sent to Columbia to discuss the seized funds with the Columbian government. After that,the operation is escalated and the US troops are ordered to begin assassinating cartel leaders themselves,who have met to assuage their own suspicions that each other are responsible for the strikes by US troops and avert a gang war.In response,a former Castro official working as an intelligence officer for one of the surviving cartel leaders figures out that American troops have been operating in Columbia and negotiates their betrayal with the President&apos;s National Security Advisor (Cutter) who orchestrated the unconstitutional operation.Meanwhile,Ryan has also caught on that something illicit is happening and catches the basic gist of the operation after breaking into a colleague&apos;s office computer at CIA. He is too late to prevent the betrayal of the US soldiers in Columbia who are captured after their exact location is given to a cartel and all air support and communications with them are cut off. Ryan personally returns to Columbia to organize a rescue operation,which he cobbles together with the help of a disgruntled CIA operative who had been involved in the military operation itself.Ryan returns to Washington DC,to reveal all details of the operation to Congress even after the President personally tries to entice him to remain silence with offers of future favours.</Plot>

        <Plot>Max is a cab driver in Los Angeles. One night he picks up Annie,a beautiful DA. The two have very friendly chat where Annie talks about her nervousness over her upcoming trial appearance and Max discusses his dream business,a limo company. At the end of the ride Annie gives Max her card. Annie leaves the cab and goes inside her building to work on her important case.A man approaches the cab,and Max almost doesn&apos;t notice him,but he gets the man in anyway. The man introduces himself as Vincent. He&apos;s very friendly and offers Max $600 to drive him around for the entire night. Max reluctantly agrees. As the two chat,Vincent says that he hates Los Angeles because it is impersonal. He recalls a news story about a man who died on the subway but remained on the train for hours without anyone noticing. Max tells Vincent about his dream of opening a limo company,describing his job as a cab driver as temporary. Vincent asks how long he has been doing it,and Max confesses that his &quot;temporary&quot; job has lasted 12 years.Vincent has Max drive him to an apartment building. Vincent goes upstairs as Max eats a sandwich. Suddenly,a dead body falls on the roof and windshield of Max&apos;s cab,breaking the glass,denting the roof and breaking the light dome on top. Vincent comes downstairs and reveals that he shot the man. He forces Max at gunpoint to help him hide the body in the cab&apos;s trunk. They wash the blood off the car an repair the light dome. Max begs Vincent to let him go,but Vincent insists that he go with him. They are later pulled over by the LAPD,who notice the damage to Max&apos; cab. Max is able to stall them for a few minutes by saying he hit a deer; the police are called away to handle another incident. Not long after,Max receives a call from his boss,who had received a call from the police informing him of the damage. Vincent instructs Max to tell his boss off and poses as an attorney,telling Max&apos; boss that insurance will pay for the damage. He also tells Max to insult his boss,which Max reluctantly does.As the evening continues,Vincent has Max deliver him to more places where Vincent kills people. He has to kill five people by the end of the night. Meanwhile,a Detective Fanning is chasing the two,slowly figuring out what is going on. He pieces together several clues involving the people Vincent has killed,determining that the killer has used the same method to shoot them all; two shots in the chest and one in the skull.Despite the circumstance,Vincent seems to take a liking to Max,who doesn&apos;t return the favor. They later visit Max&apos; mother in the hospital; Vincent wants Max&apos; evening work to appear as normal as possible to avoid suspicion. Max manages to slip away from Vincent with Vincent&apos;s bag,containing his laptop and the identity records of his targets. Max runs over a pedestrian bridge over an expressway and tosses the laptop over the fence where it&apos;s run over by a truck. Vincent responds by forcing Max to go to the man,who ordered these hits,a drug dealing gangster,Felix,and retrieve the information. Max pretends to be Vincent to the mob boss,and successfully gets the remaining info for the hits. By this time,Fanning has joined an FBI stakeout of Felix&apos;s club and identifies Max,whom he thinks is the killer,as a cabbie. Fanning joins the FBI in following the cab. Meanwhile,Felix,questioning his confidence in Vincent,also has him followed by his own men to insure that Vincent will complete the final two hits.Vincent and Max go to a busy night club to kill a heavily guarded target. The FBI,LAPD,and Fanning also show up; Fanning is looking specifically for Max to escort him to safety. A massive gunfight ensues where Vincent kills his target and saves Max&apos;s life. Detective Fanning finds Max and is leading him out when Vincent appears behind him and shoots the police officer.Max and Vincent escape the carnage and head for the third mark. By this time Max has reached his breaking point and deliberately wrecks his cab. Vincent crawls out and leaves him behind. A police officer approaches Max to help him but sees the bodies Vincent hid in the trunk. While on the ground,Max sees Vincent&apos;s new computer screen and realizes that Annie is the final target,which explains why Vincent was outside that particular building earlier; he was studying the building&apos;s security systems.Max overpowers the cop and takes his gun. He races to Annie&apos;s building and reaches her at the same time Vincent does. Max shoots Vincent and runs away with Annie. However,Vincent survives his injury and chases the two of them onto a subway train. Vincent and Max fire their guns at one another,with Vincent sustaining mortal wounds. Vincent asks Max if he thinks anyone will notice his body. He dies in a sitting position as Max and Annie leave the train.</Plot>

        <Plot>During a US Civil War battle,Union Army Officer Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Kevin Costner) learns that his injured leg is to be amputated. Seeing the plight of fellow soldiers with amputated legs,Dunbar refuses amputation and attempts suicide by riding a horse across the line of fire,between the opposing Union and Confederate positions. His action has the unexpected effect of rallying his comrades,who storm the distracted Confederates and win the battle. After the ensuing battle,an experienced general&apos;s surgeon saves Dunbar&apos;s leg. The commanding officer recognizes Dunbar as a hero and gives him Cisco,the horse who carried him in battle,and offers Dunbar his choice of posting.Dunbar,anxious to see the Western frontier before it ends,requests transfer west. After meeting with Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin),who has slipped into delusions of grandeur (apparently believing he is a king and Dunbar a medieval knight),he is paired with a drayage teamster named Timmons (Robert Pastorelli),who conveys Dunbar to his post. After the departure of Timmons and Dunbar,Fambrough commits suicide with his own pistol.After a scenic journey,Dunbar and Timmons arrive with fresh supplies at the desolate Fort Sedgwick,finding it deserted except for a lone wolf that Dunbar later befriends and dubs Two Socks,because of the coloring of its front legs. Dunbar,while waiting for reinforcements to arrive,sets about bringing order the deserted post,left in complete disarray by its previous occupants. Meanwhile,Timmons,while returning to their point of departure,is ambushed by Pawnee Indians and scalped. Timmons&apos; death and the suicide of the major who sent them there prevents Union officers from knowing of Dunbar&apos;s assignment to the post,effectively isolating Dunbar. Dunbar remains unaware of the full situation and its implications. He notes in his journal how strange it is that no more soldiers join him at the post.Dunbar initially encounters Sioux neighbors when the tribe&apos;s medicine man,Kicking Bird (Graham Greene),happens upon the fort while Dunbar bathes out of sight,and,assuming it abandoned,attempts to capture Cisco. After Dunbar scares off Kicking Bird,he is confronted by an aggressive warrior named Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant),who declares that he is not scared of the white man. Eventually,Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird,but the language barrier frustrates them. On his way to visit the tribe&apos;s camp,Dunbar interrupts the suicide attempt of Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell),a white woman captured by the tribe as a child and recently widowed,who recovers and acts as a translator. Dunbar finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe,and becomes a hero among the Sioux and accepted as an honorary member of the tribe after he helps them locate a migrating herd of buffalo,which they depend upon as a source of food,material,and clothing.Dunbar further helps defend the settlement against a Pawnee raiding party,providing the Sioux warriors with surplus rifles and ammunition from the fort. He eventually is accepted as a full member of the tribe. After members of the tribe witness him playing with Two Socks,he is named ugmánitu Taka Ob&apos;wahi (&quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;; ugmánitu Taka means large coyote,the Lakota word for wolf). Dunbar falls in love with Stands With A Fist,a relationship forbidden by the recent death of her husband in battle but consummated in secret. The two eventually win the approval of Kicking Bird,who takes on the role of her father,and marry. Dunbar subsequently spends more time living with the tribe than manning his post at Fort Sedgwick. Wind In His Hair,his last rival,acknowledges him as a friend.Dunbar&apos;s idyll ends when he tells Kicking Bird that white men will continue to invade their land in &quot;numbers like the stars.&quot; They tell Chief Ten Bears (Floyd &apos;Red Crow&apos; Westerman),who decides it is time to move the village to its winter camp. As the packing finishes,Dunbar realizes that his journal,left behind at the deserted fort,is a blueprint for finding the tribe,revealing that he knows far too much about their ways. Wearing Indian clothing,he returns to Fort Sedgwick to retrieve the journal but finds it is has suddenly been occupied by newly arrived Army troops. They see Dunbar and initially assuming he is an Indian,kill his horse Cisco and capture Dunbar.When they recognize Dunbar as a white man,they treat him as a deserter,and beat him during an interrogation. Dunbar tells Lt. Elgin (Charles Rocket) (whom Dunbar met earlier in Maj. Fambrough&apos;s office) that he has a journal containing his orders for his posting to Fort Sedgwick. Spivey (Tony Pierce),one of the first soldiers to arrive at the fort,denies the existence of the journal,which he had found and has in his pocket. After further beating,Dunbar declares in the Lakota language that his name is Dances With Wolves. Army officers and a few troops set off to deliver Dunbar to Fort Hayes for execution. When they happen upon Two Socks,they shoot at the wolf,who refuses to leave Dunbar. Despite his attempts to intervene,Two Socks is fatally wounded,and the convoy moves off.Soon after,Wind In His Hair and other warriors from the tribe attack the column of men,rescuing Dunbar. Smiles A Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse) retrieves Dunbar&apos;s journal floating in a stream. After returning to the winter camp,Dunbar realizes that as a deserter and fugitive,he will continue to draw the unwelcome attention of the Army and endanger the welfare of the tribe if he stays with the Sioux. Under the protests of his Sioux friends,Dunbar decides that he must leave the tribe,saying he must speak to those who would listen. His wife decides to accompany him.As Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist leave the camp,Wind In His Hair cries out that Dances with Wolves will always be his friend,a remembrance of their first confrontation. Shortly afterward,a column of cavalry and Pawnee army scouts arrive to find their former camp site empty.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with the eruption of an unnamed volcano in Colombia during which volcanologist Dr. Harry Daltons (Brosnan) and his fiancée,Marianne (Walker Brandt) are trying to escape in a jeep along with the panicked locals. Rushing through the adrenaline filled race they are confident of escape and seem almost to make it when a lump of molten lava crashes through the roof fo the jeep and hits Marianne on the head and killing her outright.Four years later the story moves to the Northern Cascade Mountains and a little town resting directly besides a large,powerful and possibly dangerous volcano. Dante&apos;s Peak (the town) receives an award on a warm summer day,congratulating the town on being the second best place to live,population under 20,000 whilst celebrating its annual &quot;Pioneer Days Festival&quot;. After two backpackers are killed in the hot springs by active volcanic activity,Doctor Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan,Mrs. Doubtfire) is sent there to evaluate the town&apos;s dormant volcano. Trying to convince the town council to put the town on alert for evacuation,Harry&apos;s boss Doctor Paul Dreyfuss (Charles Hallahan,Space Jam) convinces them that putting a town on alert would mean a literal finanical nightmare for them and other neighboring towns around the state. Refusing to believe Paul&apos;s decision,Harry convinces the town mayor,Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton,Terminator) to watch out for any threat that would come off of that mountain. Days later,the mountain begins to cause major problems,ranging from sewer leaks to mild earthquakes. Now convinced that the town is in danger of a volcanic eruption,Paul gives the order to put the town on alert. But,it is just too late. The mountain explodes. Massive amounts of ash cover the town. Day turns to night. Horrible and raging fires break out everywhere. Being in this kind of situation before,Harry and Rachel make a run for their lives as they battle through the ash,lava,and acid as they rush through the collapsing town and as they battle more challenging obstacles when they go after Rachel&apos;s children who rush up the mountain to get their grandmother. Battling against the volcano,Harry,Rachel,and the children are the only people left in the now abandoned and destroyed town. The only real challenge lies ahead where the second eruption is yet to come. Buildings fall. Lives are lost. Highways crumble. Hope lurks in the shadows. Don&apos;t look back!</Plot>

        <Plot>Within four years from 2008 the economy of the United States has fallen into disaster,Unemployment and crime rises,and private corporations run most prisons across the nation for profit. The movie focuses on the Terminal Island Prison,which broadcast &quot;Death Race&quot; to the world via a popular paysite on internet. Death Race is not only a race to the finish line,but a battle pitting car against car.The film begins by showing a race near its end between Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) and a famous masked driver known as Frankenstein (David Carradine in a cameo appearance),who is accompanied by a female navigator. Frank&apos;s defensive systems fail,and Joe destroys Frank&apos;s car (his navigator ejects),presumably leaving Frankenstein critically wounded,or dead.Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for his wife&apos;s murder on the same day that the steel mill he works at closes; the murderer is actually a masked intruder that points a finger-gun at Ames as he leaves. Ames is sent to prison where he is coerced by the sadistic prison warden,Hennessey (Joan Allen) to become the new driver of Frankenstein&apos;s Ford Mustang. She tells Ames that she knows of his baby that was left in foster care,and that prisoners are freed upon winning five Death Races,but since he will take on the mask of the legendary Frankenstein,who had 4 wins at the time of his death,he will only need to win one race. The races are broken apart into three stages: Stage 1 and 2 are races in which the driver must survive,and Stage 3 you must win the race in order for it to add to the count towards freedom.Just before the Stage 1 Race,Ames is introduced to his navigator,Elizabeth Case (Natalie Martinez),who happens to be Frankenstein&apos;s previous navigator. During the race,Ames see another driver,Pachenko,make the same hand gesture as the intruder that killed his wife. Three drivers are killed during Stage 1: Siad,Grimm,and Travis Colt. Ames finishes last after taking a hard hit from Machine Gun Joe.Ames learns he is part of a plot to keep the legend of Frankenstein alive,solely for the personal profit of Hennessey. He confronts Hennessey about the driver,but instead she shows him pictures of his baby living with foster parents,asking him if he thinks he could provide for his baby better than the foster parents. Angered,he takes one of the pictures and leaves. The night before Stage 2 he makes a trip to the garage of Pachenko&apos;s team to confront him. He is beaten down by a few members of the team but is helped by a member of his garage allowing Ames to retaliate and nearly kill Pachenko. His revenge is thwarted by the prison guards telling them to save it for the race.Ames goes into the Stage 2 race and immediately questions Case on her intentions. She tells him she was ordered to sabotage Frankenstein&apos;s defense weapons so he would not win his freedom,and thereby earn her own. Ames realizes he is not meant to survive the Death Race at all,but is meant to die so another &quot;Frankenstein&quot; can be brought into the prison to keep viewers paying to see the races. He seeks revenge during Stage 2 by crippling and rolling Pachenko&apos;s car allowing him to turn around drive back and to get revenge up close and personal by snapping Pachenko&apos;s neck as he crawls away from the car wreck. Five drivers remain until 14K,Carson,and Riggins are killed by &apos;The Dreadnought&apos;,Hennessy&apos;s secret weapon,the Dreadnaught,(an 18 wheel tank truck filled with massive machine guns) that had been in production for months. Ames and Machine Gun Joe are able to destroy The Dreadnought and finish Stage 2. Realizing that Ames knows what&apos;s going on,Hennessey has Ames&apos; car armed with an explosive before the Stage 3 Race as insurance to make sure he does not cross the finish line alive. However,Ames devises his own scheme from an image shown by one of his crew members of a destroyed billboard in an earlier race,and tells Joe that he and Frankenstein should talk.The Stage 3 Race begins with only two drivers remaining: &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Machine Gun Joe. The race begins,and Ames soon takes the lead. However,the odds are against Ames as Hennessey rigs the track to benefit Joe. Throughout the entire lap,Joe keeps hot on Ames&apos; tail,and as they near the beginning of the second lap,Joe preps newly added missiles and fires an RPG in Ames&apos; direction. However,they seem to miss the car and instead hit the billboard at the first turn of the track. It is shown that the image Ames saw was a pathway to the bridge leading off the island to the mainland behind the destroyed billboard.Ames and Joe escape onto the bridge,pursued by police cruisers and helicopters. As the cruisers close in on the two cars,Ames releases his exposed fuel tank,causing it to explode and stop the pursuing cars. Turning to her back up plan,Hennessey then orders that the explosive under Ames&apos; car be set off,but nothing happens because Coach (Ames&apos; mechanic) had found,removed,and deactivated the bomb prior to the start of the race. Escaping past the bridge,Joe and Ames separate,and Hennessey orders the helicopters to focus on Ames,but he switches seats with Case when she tells him that Hennessey had already signed her release papers for her work,and that she owed one to the old Frankenstein. He jumps from the car leading the helicopters to believe he is still inside. Joe meets up with Ames and they board a train to escape,lamenting on Hennessey&apos;s continued existence. Soon,Ames&apos; Mustang is stopped and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is apprehended.Later,Hennessey believes she still won after all,as a guard notifies her about presents sent to her for the record number of viewers subscribing to the Death Race. However,the explosive that was put on the Frankenstein car is inside,and Coach blows them up.Six months later,Ames and Joe are shown working in a junkyard in Mexico,when Case unexpectedly arrives. The two men are happy to see her,and Case meets Ames&apos; baby,Piper. The movie closes with Ames explaining that even though he knows he&apos;s far from being the best parent in the world,no one could love his baby more than he could.</Plot>

        <Plot>Deep Impact opens to a starry night sky in Richmond,Virginia. The camera slowly pans down where stargazers and amateur astronomers are gathered with telescopes. Among these are students and faculty of the Lee High School Astronomy Club. Two students at this club are Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend,Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski). As they look through their telescopes at the stars,Leo innocently asks Sarah about another male student who invited her to a student party.Leo and Sarah&apos;s teacher,Mr. Perry (Mike O&apos;Malley) comes up and quizzes them about some of the brighter stars. Leo correctly identifies the stars Mizar and Alcor,but cannot name a somewhat smaller,dimmer star a bit south of the other two,although he is sure that it is not the star Megrez,as Sarah claims. Mr. Perry,thinking it might be a satellite,suggests they take a photograph and send it to Dr. Wolf,a professional astronomer who sponsors the Lee High School Astronomy club. As Perry walks away,Leo and Sarah get into a brief,teasing argument about whether the unidentified star is Megrez.Dr. Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith,uncredited) arrives for work at the Adrian Peak observatory in Tuscon,Arizona. Seating himself at his work station,he finds the packet sent him by Leo,containing a photograph of the unknown star near Mizar and Alcor,and a cover letter asking him to identify it. Punching the stellar coordinates into his computer,he sees it is an uncharted object. His observatory&apos;s telescopes zooming in on it,he sees it is in fact a comet. Curious about it,he directs his computer to analyze the comet&apos;s position and calculate its trajectory. As the numbers begin to scroll through the screen,Dr. Wolf&apos;s curious expression fades into a look of severe worry and concern. An orbital interpolation graphic on his monitor overlays the comet&apos;s projected path on a small display of the solar system-- and a large dot quickly appears on the third elliptical line around the sun&apos;s icon; the comet is projected to strike Earth.Seizing a floppy disk,Wolf saves all the data to it while instructing his computer to open a UNIX mail server to send the information out in email. After over a minute,however,he only gets two responses that the server is down. Exasperated and in a desperate hurry,Dr. Wolf grabs the floppy and stuffs it,along with the packet received from Leo,into a padded manila envelops. He writes his own surname and Leo&apos;s surname (Wolf-Beiderman) on the floppy drive and rushes out of the observatory to his jeep. As he races down the road,he struggles desperately to place a call on his cell phone to the Department of Planetary Sciences. Cell phone technology of the year (1998) being crude and limited,it takes him several long,harrowing minutes just to reach the automated answering system. Meanwhile,an 18-wheel big-rig truck is coming down the road. The driver,smoking a cigarette and listening to country music,is badly sleep-deprived; drinking a high-sugar soft drink to keep himself awake. As Dr. Wolf,pre-occupied with trying to finish placing his call and reaching a live person,focuses more on his phone than on the road,the driver&apos;s cigarette slips from his mouth,hitting his lap. The pain causes him to involuntarily look down while he bats at his lap and the ash from his cigarette. Both Dr. Wolf and the truck driver finally look up,alerted to the shine of each others&apos; headlights,and see they&apos;re about to collide. Both desperately try to swerve,but the truck&apos;s cab lags behind in the swerve and Dr. Wolf&apos;s jeep slams into it,and he&apos;s knocked off of the road and down an incline. The envelope flies off of the seat beside Dr. Wolf and out the window of his jeep as it tumbles down the incline and explodes,killing him instantly.Washington,D.C.,one year later. MSNBC computers are transmitting a news report. In a conference room,a small team of news reporters led by Stuart Caley (Bruce Weitz) are discussing the resignation of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury,Alan Rittenhouse (James Cromwell). Rittenhouse is reportedly resigning because his wife is sick,although Caley&apos;s team doesn&apos;t buy it,going over a number of unpopular decisions recently made by Rittenhouse which has earned him more than enough enemies to force him out of his seat. The team jokes that with all the trouble Rittenhouse has recently gotten into,it&apos;s small wonder his wife is sick.But reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) demurs,saying Mrs. Rittenhouse is an alcoholic. She claims to have found out from a connection in the U.S. Treasury named Mike Woodward. As the news team starts discussing an idea on the price paid by wives of governmental figures,Jenny is asked about her connection to Woodward by Beth Stanley (Laura Innes),the news team&apos;s White House correspondent and Jenny&apos;s direct supervisor on the ladder. Jenny explains that Woodward has a crush on her,and she took advantage of it to get information on Alan Rittenhouse. At that point,Jenny quickly asks Beth about the possibility of stepping into a recently-vacated anchor position in their late-night weekend news broadcast,but Beth quickly rules Jenny out as a replacement anchor. As the conference adjourns,Jenny tries to press Beth on it,and Beth (a bit impatiently) explains why she feels Jenny needs more time to build herself up before being a weekend news anchor. She asks Jenny to find out more on the Rittenhouse resignation and have any updates on her desk by the next day.Jenny meets her mother,Robin Lerner (Vanessa Redgrave) for drinks and lunch. Robin is preoccupied with the courtship of her now ex-husband,Jason (Maximilian Schell) to a younger woman named Chloe (Rya Kihlstedt)-- in fact,the age difference is such that Chloe is only two years older than Jenny,despite now legally being her stepmother. Jason and Chloe have very young twin children together and have just married that morning,and Robin prattles on about it.Carrying on with her assignment,Jenny meets with Patricia Ruiz (Concetta Tomei),longtime former assistant and secretary for Rittenhouse. Ruiz is somewhat bitter because she was completely dismissed from her position without being conveyed to Rittenhouse&apos;s successor,because she followed him from his former position as Connecticut governor,not hired from within the federal pool. Ruiz confirms that Rittenhouse cheated on his wife,and she suspects he resigned because he was about to be found out. Ruiz,therefore,partially blames Rittenhouse for her now being out of a job. She says that Rittenhouse had had a special,secondary private telephone line installed in his office that only he was authorized to answer. But,Ruiz says,one day she overheard a name; a woman&apos;s first name she suspects as being one of Rittenhouse&apos;s lovers: Ellie. Ruiz also mentions she overheard Rittenhouse speaking about this Ellie in a conversation with the U.S. President himself.Jenny arrives with an MSNBC news van to speak directly to Rittenhouse. They find him on a small boat with his young adolescent daughter,who is cold and suspicious of the news crew. Rittenhouse curtly tries to stick to his story about his wife being ill,until Jenny drops Ellie&apos;s name. Rittenhouse says he will only speak to Jenny if her cameraman turns his camera off. Once this is done,Jenny reveals what she&apos;s found out; more than enough to disprove the claimed reason behind Rittenhouse&apos;s resignation. Rittenhouse insists she knows far less than she thinks she does,and tries to appeal to Jenny&apos;s humanity,asking if she can understand that he wants to be with his family more.Driving down the highway by herself now,Jenny speaks into her private voice recorder,making a personal log in which she hypothesizes that the President,not Rittenhouse,was having a love affair with this Ellie,and Rittenhouse took the rap for him to protect the President&apos;s own reputation and credibility,and was given significant financial compensation. Suddenly a black car hits hers from behind,not hard enough to overturn her car but hard enough to jostle her and make her take immediate notice. And this car is not alone-- three others are in formation,moving to surround Jenny&apos;s car. The car behind her bumps hers a second time. Scared out of her wits,Jenny realizes these men are intent on forcing her to take the nearest exit off the highway and shouts to the car on her left that she will comply.The exit&apos;s re-merge into another highway is barricaded with a setup of road pylons. Jenny brings her car to a stop and the car in front of hers moves to block her from any further motion. The men in one of the cars pull open Jenny&apos;s driver-side door and identify themselves as FBI,ordering her out of her vehicle and into their own. One of them gets into Jenny&apos;s car to drive it where they are taking her.The FBI agents bring Jenny into a kitchen (presumed to be the White House kitchen) where she is introduced to Morton Entrekin (O&apos;Neal Compton),chief advisor to President Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman). When Jenny rebuffs Entrekin&apos;s mentioning that people knew about the Manhattan project (creation of the atom bomb) and kept it a secret,President Beck comes into the kitchen to speak personally to Jenny. Both Beck and Entrekin are clearly unenthused about Jenny&apos;s attitude,hinting that national security is at stake. When she drops Ellie&apos;s name,Beck asks her about it,although he pronounces it,&quot;E.L.E.&quot;Beck confirms that his administration has spent more money than can be hidden,and the federal budget is slated to be published in two weeks. They ask her to sit the story until then,appealing to her sense of what is in the nation&apos;s best interest. Jenny knocks both points out of the water quickly,at which point Beck and Entrekin decide to play hardball with her. Beck agrees to hold a press conference in two days,and offers Jenny a reserved second-row seat there,which he knows will be a major bump up from her current job. When she tries to press for more,Beck warns her sternly that she is already receiving a presidential favor-- something people like her can rarely even dream of-- and he can direct the Secret Service to imprison her indefinitely as a threat to national security. Jenny backs down quickly,politely asking for the first press question at the conference. Beck answers dismissively before ordering she be released.Back at her desk in the MSNBC news offices,Jenny goes on the internet to research. Understanding now that &apos;Ellie&apos; is an acronym for ELE,she enters that into a search engine. Dissatisfied with the results,she thinks and then enters E.L.E. with the periods. Puzzled at the result display of the University of Berkeley&apos;s paleontology department,she looks through the university&apos;s list of studies and notices a link to Extinction Studies. Reading through it,Jenny learns the grim truth: E.L.E stands for Extinction Level Event; the kind resulting from severe global-level catastrophe,such as the extinction of the dinosaurs... presumed to be the result of a massive comet or meteor strike on the Earth. Jenny is barely able to hide her monitor display when Beth stops by to invite her to dinner. Jenny politely declines as she is scheduled to meet her father and Chloe for drinks later.The meeting with Jason and Chloe goes badly. Chloe gives Jenny a pair of pearl earrings as a present,looking to break the ice with her and try to establish a cordial relationship. But Jenny is every bit as bitter as Robin,about Jason&apos;s leaving Robin for a younger,more beautiful woman... and Jenny proves to be more vocal about it as well. E.L.E weighs very heavily on Jenny&apos;s mind as well,though she doesn&apos;t bring it up,further baffling Jason and Chloe at Jenny&apos;s coldness.The day of the press conference arrives. Beth is attending,as MSNBC&apos;s White House correspondent,and is surprised to find Jenny there-- even more so when Entrekin (with whom Beth is acquainted) comes to escort Jenny to her reserved seat. Entrekin tells Jenny she will get the first question.President Beck takes the podium to make the announcement of the comet. The comet was discovered one year ago by two astronomers,Marcus Wolf and Leo Beiderman. This comet is nearly as large as all of Manhattan Island-- large enough to endanger all of human existence. Beck downplays the comet somewhat,saying there is a &quot;chance&quot; of impact one year from then. He then reveals the whole Treasury fiasco was due to a secret joint project that the U.S. government had been undertaking with Russia for the past eight months. In orbit above the earth,a massive spacecraft is near completion,named the Messiah. This spacecraft is tasked with intercepting the comet and using nuclear warheads to try and shunt its orbit to avoid direct contact with Earth.Beck calls up a video conference to introduce the crew of the Messiah-- mission Commander Oren Monash (Ron Eldard),spacecraft pilot Andrea Baker (Mary McCormack),medical officer Gus Partenza (Jon Favreau),navigator Mark Simon (Blair Underwood),Russian nuclear physicist Col. Mikhail Tulchinsky (Aleksandr Baluev) who is serving as Messiah&apos;s engineer,and a NASA veteran,Captain Spurgeon &apos;Fish&apos; Tanner (Robert Duvall),who will land the spacecraft on the comet&apos;s surface so the warheads can be planted.Beck gives the nation a stern warning that he is freezing all wages and prices,and will fiercely combat all attempts at material hoarding and profiteering. Work and paying of bills will continue as normal with as few disruptions to the world&apos;s way of life as possible.Opening up the floor for questions,Beck calls on Jenny for the first question as he agreed to do. Jenny&apos;s MSNBC crew,in a frenzy over preparing their coverage of the conference,are stunned to see her at the conference. Jenny presses her privilege,asking three questions before finally sitting. Her third question shows everyone that she was on to the whole story before anyone else: she directly questions Beck on Rittenhouse&apos;s resignation,asking whether the true reasons for his stepping down was because he believed that the comet could not be stopped,and he wanted to spend time with his family because he believes they didn&apos;t have much time left to live.Beck defensively answers that Rittenhouse served the country with devotion and resigned for personal reasons after a distinguished career. As far as Rittenhouse&apos;s concerns regarding the comet,Beck points out that over the next year,everyone on Earth will eventually have to come face to face with their worst fears. As much as he&apos;d been downplaying it in the conference,Beck finally acknowledges that all of human survival is at stake. But,he insists,life will go on,and he is determined that humanity prevail even over this potential catastrophe.When questioned by another reporter about the comet being named Wolf-Beiderman,Beck begins to explain that the two astronomers were killed in Arizona a year ago while racing to alert the government about the comet. As Beck explains this story,the Beiderman family is at home watching the conference,shocked at what they are hearing-- Leo is very much alive and well,at home watching with his family. The door rings and Leo finds Sarah there with her parents,and the whole neighborhood is beginning to converge on the Beiderman home,seeing that Leo is still quite with them all.Newsweek publishes a story about Leo and the events regarding his supposed death. Leo speaks to his school and the students&apos; families regarding his notifying Dr. Wolf about the comet,and he realizes that he was most likely presumed to have perished along with Wolf because Wolf shared credit with Leo about the comet&apos;s discovery. Leo quickly gains near celebrity status over having first discovered the comet.The Messiah crew and their families are attending a small garden party which gives us a look into their day to day lives. Baker and Commander Monash are both married; Baker and her husband have a young daughter while Monash&apos;s wife is pregnant with their first child. Simon is engaged and looking forward to his wedding,but less than enthused about his fiancée&apos;s affinity for attending church. Capt. Tanner is widowed with twin sons grown to young adulthood and attending Naval Academy where Tanner himself graduated from. Tanner is also friends with Otis &apos;Mitch&apos; Hefter (Kurtwood Smith),a senior NASA official who will serve as mission control director at a facility in Houston. Tanner and Hefter talk about the rest of the Messiah crew,about whom Tanner has concerns regarding their training being done in simulators,and they have little actual space flight experience.Partenza talks with a young boy and explains the hazards of the mission: the comet&apos;s rotational period means the Messiah crew only has a seven hour window before the sun will &apos;rise&apos; on the section they will be working on,and during the time that the sun is shining on that segment,there will be dangerous and volatile outgassings from the comet&apos;s interior. The Messiah crew needs to work quickly to avoid this hazard.Later that evening,the crew members are relaxing and drinking at a bar,though Tanner sits separately from the others. He overhears them talking about him. The other crew members respect Tanner&apos;s reputation,but they downplay Tanner&apos;s having been the last astronaut to walk on the moon,and believe that he is only on the mission more as a public relations move by Washington,because he is a familiar face. Tanner finally goes over to their table and says he knows that the other crew members don&apos;t want him with them,but he insists they will need his experience-- all of their simulator training will be like a video game compared to the actual mission. He is the only one with actual experience landing a spacecraft on an actual landing surface.Two months later,the Messiah crew is ferried by the space shuttle Atlantis to dock with the orbital station on which the Messiah was constructed. A news crew explains the Messiah&apos;s construction,and that it is powered by a prototype nuclear propulsion system code-named Orion,that was originally developed by Russian engineers for nuclear warfare. This propulsion system will allow the Messiah&apos;s crew to reach the comet well in advance of its arriving close to Earth.Five months after the Messiah&apos;s departure,Caley&apos;s MSNBC news crew is meeting for another conference,discussing their ongoing coverage of the Messiah&apos;s mission. Everyone is asked about their role and latest contributions. Caley announces (to Beth&apos;s shock) that Jenny has been given a news anchor position for the coverage program. Being known as the one who broke the story on the comet,Jenny has likewise gained a great deal of national status.The Messiah crew begins its approach to the comet,and they are in awe of its true size. They are making preparations to detach the main spacecraft from its propulsion system and fly down to the comet&apos;s surface to plant their nuclear warheads. Monash,Simon,Partenza,and Tulchinsky suit up for the planting of the warheads while Baker and Tanner are at the helm for the landing. Tanner gives an analogy of Mississippi River boat pilots,to explain that this part of the mission is in his hands and he will deliver the Messiah safely to the comet&apos;s surface. Baker smiles respectfully as she listens to Tanner&apos;s analogy.Jenny begins her news program&apos;s coverage of the event. She tells everyone watching that interference from rock,gravel and gas from the comet will eventually cause them to lose video transmission with the Messiah. As she speaks,the picture is lost and Jenny assures everyone that the station coverage will continue and they will stay on air during the next hour in which the mission is being undertaken. The Beiderman and Hotchner families are shown watching the program together; Sarah&apos;s mother,Vicky Hotchner (Denise Crosby) is pregnant with her second child,and Leo and Sarah are growing closer.As Baker and Tanner maneuver the Messiah for landing,they must fly through a veritable minefield of rocks caught in the comet&apos;s tail. Some of them are very large. Despite their best efforts,a few rocks hit the ship and some minor damage is sustained. They nonetheless manage to bring the Messiah safely down,fire tether pitons and land intact on the comet&apos;s surface. As they open the cargo bay doors so the surface crew can begin drilling into the comet to plant the warheads,Baker and Tanner start a computerized countdown. They have just under six and a half hours before &apos;sunrise&apos; on their part of the comet.Jenny begins an explanation of the next procedure of the Messiah mission: mechanical moles will be used to drill 100 meters into the comet,each one carrying a 5000 kiloton nuclear warhead. The Messiah is carrying eight of them in total.Almost immediately the mission begins going awry. The moles prove to be unable to drill as deeply into the comet&apos;s surface,as quickly as is required. They are at just over an hour and a half before sunrise. Baker and Tanner,waiting anxiously in the spacecraft,know it is taking too long.In the MSNBC news office,Jenny is interviewing a NASA scientist,who explains that soon as the sun rises on the portion of the comet that the Messiah is on,the surface temperature will rise 350 degrees in minutes,creating enough pressure to expel jets of superheated gas up through the surface. This will make the mission akin to working in a minefield.On the comet surface,one of the moles gets stuck at 75 meters. The crew knows this is not deep enough; the warhead will just break pieces off the comet&apos;s surface. Commander Monash decides to descend into the shaft dug by the stuck mole to try and free it up,despite warnings from the other crew about the time pressure. Baker tells Tanner that in another six minutes,they won&apos;t be able to get back to the spacecraft for liftoff before sunrise.Tanner orders the tethers be detached; he&apos;s taking the craft up to bring closer to the mole crew to pick them up; over Baker&apos;s desperate protests that such a maneuver may exhaust too much of the spacecraft landing module&apos;s fuel supply to get safely off the comet&apos;s surface. Tanner tells Baker to calculate exactly how much fuel will be needed to get off the surface; they will stop thrusters when they hit it. The mole crew is racing against time; one mole is at the proper depth but Oren is still struggling to reach the stuck one. The shaft went into a natural cave-like fissure in the comet&apos;s interior and the mole got stuck against the side. The mole crew works feverishly but unsuccessfully to free the mole. The landing module reaches the limit on spare fuel and Baker has to speak sharply before Tanner finally complies with her insistence to shut down the module&apos;s thrusters and land again.The stuck mole finally begins drilling again and Commander Monash desperately climbs his tether cable so the crew can get back to the Messiah. The horizon is a mere minute away from sunrise and counting. Outgasses are beginning to explode up through the comet surface.The horizon is bridged. Tulchinsky shouts urgently for the surface crew to lower their visors&apos; solar shields. The crew is out of time and has to race back to the Messiah before they are caught in outgassing vents. Just as Monash clears the surface,a gas jet shoots him upward before he can lower his visor&apos;s shield. The full brilliance of the sun shines through his visor into his unprotected eyes. The rest of the crew reels him in by the tether cable and races desperately toward the Messiah landing module.Mere feet from safety,an outgas jet erupts full force directly under Partenza,shooting him up off the comet&apos;s surface. Despite frantic attempts by both the mole crew,and Baker and Tanner,Partenza is blown out into open space and lost. The rest of the crew barely manages to reach the landing module; Tanner has to order Baker to lift off with the cargo doors open and close them as they go. Damage to the Messiah limits full video feed transmission back to Earth. Tanner relays the grim news that Tanner is lost and Monash is injured (his wife,Mariette,is seen crying as she hears the news).Tulchinsky vehemently argues to go after Partenza. Tanner barely succeeds in persuading him that Partenza is lost,and all of them will die and the Messiah destroyed if they try to locate and retrieve him. That would doom the entire population of Earth.Continuing news coverage at the MSNBC studio,Jenny gives a summary of Partenza&apos;s career in NASA in tribute to his sacrifice for the mission. Relaying updates as she gets them,she informs the people that Captain Tanner is now in command of the Messiah. It has docked with the Orion booster propulsion unit and is preparing to detonate the nuclear warheads. She cautions everyone that the blast effect will again nullify whatever video transmission the Messiah is able to send back to Earth.Col. Tulchinsky coordinates the arming of the nuclear warheads. Tanner prepares to activate Orion boosters soon as the countdown is complete. Despite this,the Messiah is still caught in the nuclear shockwave and further damaged. All video and audio transmission is knocked out. President Back is seen in a White House office with Entrenkin,the cabinet,and a number of leading military Chiefs of Staff. A phone rings,and the member answering it looks at Beck grimly.President Beck goes on the air to deliver the news to the country. The warhead detonation only succeeded in breaking off a significantly large chunk of the comet-- 1.5 miles wide-- large enough to cause catastrophic damage to the planet in its own right. Both this chunk and larger,six-mile main piece of the comet are still heading straight toward Earth. Houston Mission Control cannot communicate further with the Messiah although they are able to continue tracking it via radar. Its condition and the status of the crew are unknown.Beck announces contingency plans that were in place from the moment of the comet&apos;s discovery. The United States and Russia will prepare their entire joint arsenals of Titan-Class nuclear missiles to launch into space as soon as the two comet chunks,now separately named Wolf (the larger,main body of the comet) and Beiderman (the smaller chunk broken loose by the warheads) are close enough for military computers to target them,in hopes that the comet pieces can still be shunted off their current course. The U.S. has also been excavating shelter caverns in the limestone cliffs of Missouri to use as a form of Noah&apos;s Ark. This shelter will be able to contain one million people,and enough animal and plant life to repopulate the Earth after all the dust settles. The shelter will contain all living essentials,food,water,and collections of human music,art,literature,and other physical creations of its culture,to rebuild the planet. 200,000 people have been pre-selected-- leaders,doctors,scientists,engineers,teachers,soldiers and artists-- for participation in the Ark. In one month,a national lottery of 800,000 additional people will be chosen. During these final preparations,Beck is declaring martial law. The US military will work in tandem with all state and city law enforcements. Extremely strict midnight curfews are going into effect,and minimal road travel will be permitted in the evening hours after local sunsets. Crimes against people and property will be dealt with far more harshly than is the usual national norm.Other countries are preparing similar shelters in whatever manner they can. News networks all around the country are being faxed detailed instructions on how the lottery procedure will work. Showing his human side now,Beck closes his segment with a prayer for human survival.Jenny&apos;s MSNBC news program goes back on the air to explain the lottery procedure. The lottery drawing will be on August 10th,picking 800,000 people by their social security numbers. The general lottery will exclude all men and women over the age of 50. Only the body of 200,000 pre-selected individuals,including people needed for the rebuilding of society due to expertise in particular fields of study,will have any persons over 50 years old. As Jenny speaks,her parents are shown watching the news broadcast; they know this means they will both be excluded from the lottery drawing.Jenny&apos;s report continues to explain that civil defense teams are in place in all towns and cities with populations over 5,000,to organize and prepare underground shelters and instruct people on how to grow food and purify water and properly stock these shelters in whatever manner can be done. For the Noah&apos;s Ark shelter in Missouri,the 200,000 pre-selected individuals will be notified as her report is going on. After the lottery on August tenth,all unofficial travel will be blocked,all roads closed until the evacuation of all one million people by military personnel,to the Ark site,two days later.As Jenny continues her report,the Beiderman and Hotchner families are watching together at the Beiderman home in Richmond. Their phone rings. Ellen Beiderman,Leo&apos;s mother,takes the call. The Beiderman family has been pre-selected. Sarah&apos;s father,Chuck,abruptly gets up,saying he needs to go back to the house in case his phone rings. However,it is clear that an instant rift has formed between the Hotchner and Beiderman families.On board the Messiah,the crew is discussing their state. Repairs to the long-range communications will be hazardous due to hull damage in the areas of the spacecraft where they are located. There is limited life-support functions left. The Messiah will need to get close to Earth again to re-establish contact. The Orion propulsion module is still intact,but using it in order to get back to Earth sufficiently in advance of the comets will be risky because of damage to the spacecraft command module&apos;s radiation shields. As the crew ponders,Commander Monash,in sickbay with his eyes bandaged,says he feels they should try it. Tanner orders the Orion boosters engaged and the Messiah begins to race home.Jenny is taking a walk through a park in Washington with her mother. It is just over one month before the comets are due to impact. Robin has reconciled herself to her impending fate. She&apos;s donated all of her antiques to the Ark,and takes comfort in her contribution to the preservation of human arts. Jenny,however,is guilty. She&apos;s been pre-selected because of her national status as a now well-respected news anchor,but she can do nothing for Robin. However,Robin says she&apos;s at peace with herself and is happy knowing that Jenny will live.Leo goes to the Hotchner house,where Chuck is chaining up a motorbike he&apos;d bought and is now quizzical over,knowing he will have no use for it. Vicky is on the porch watching a portable TV,where Jenny is delivering news coverage. As impact looms ever closer,society is teetering ever more precariously on the brink of total anarchy. A rental operator attempted to over-gouge prices on vital tools at absurdly outlandish rates,and was killed by an angry mob. Property and stores are being looted at increasing rates by both individuals and organized gangs. Many shop and store owners have completely abandoned these stores to the looters. Law enforcement attempts to curb and rein in this free-for-all looting and hoarding,are unable to keep up with the increasing volume. As Leo helps Chuck bar up and board up his home,he starts to ask Vicky about Sarah. Anticipating Leo&apos;s question,Vicky says that Sarah is up on a nearby hill by herself. Chuck has excused her from attending school any further.Leo goes to Sarah with good news. He&apos;s talked to local civil defense liaisons,who have said that if Sarah marries Leo,she will be eligible for participation in the Ark evacuation. Sarah takes this news tentatively,saying she only wants to go if her parents can be included. Leo says his influence and fame come into play at this point; he&apos;s talked to appropriate liaisons,who have ensured that the whole Hotchner family will be able to be included in the Ark.As days continue to pass,Jenny continues to report on how law enforcement and fire fighters have abandoned all attempts to rein in looting of businesses in order to finish preparing and stocking both the Ark and all local shelter units. Robin is seen applying makeup and donning a formal dress and jewelry,making herself stately and beautiful. Leo and Sarah are married by a civil justice as their parents look on. Vicky has delivered her baby; Sarah now has a baby sister. President Beck is seen at his desk in the Oval Office,deep in contemplation. Robin sits down in a comfortable armchair and lets her head tilt back,as if letting herself drift off to sleep.The Messiah crew is asleep in their bunks,except for Commander Monash,who is still laying in the infirmary. He is stable,but permanently blind from his injury. Captain Tanner goes there to keep him company and talk. He explains his nickname of Fish-- his given name,Spurgeon,rhymes with sturgeon. The nickname was coined on his very first day at Naval Academy. As he and Monash bond,Tanner begins to read the novel Moby Dick to him,much to Monash&apos;s amusement.August 12th arrives. All individuals and families selected both by pre-selection and the lottery are on street corners to be picked up by military buses to be transported to the Ark. The Beiderman and Hotchner families wait side by side with minimal belongings packed. As Leo shows his identification and marriage license to the bus official,everyone prepares to board. But to Leo&apos;s horror,the FCDA officials he talked to have left Chuck and Vicky Hotchner,and the baby,off of the boarding list. The official&apos;s orders from his superiors are not to admit anyone on the bus who isn&apos;t on the boarding list. He cannot let Chuck or Vicky on. Sarah,breaking into tears,refuses to leave her parents despite her father&apos;s attempts to push her on with Leo. The bus crew has no time to sit and argue,they force Leo,his parents and young sister on board the bus and take off. Even though she refused to leave without her parents,Sarah cannot help but run a short distance after it,crying to Leo.Jenny is in the MSNBC offices when a phone call arrives for her. As soon as she is asked if she is the daughter of Robin Lerner,she,and everyone who overheard her repeat the question asked of her,all turn grim. Robin has died,and Jenny is being asked to positively identify the body and collect the jewelry Robin was wearing when she was found. Robin&apos;s cause of death is not stated but it is safely presumed she took her own life so her final moments and death would be peaceful and painless.After identifying Robin&apos;s body and collecting the jewelry,Jenny sits on a street bench. It is nighttime,and rain pours heavily down from the sky. Jason,who had also been notified,happens to pull alongside Jenny in his car. Jason urges Jenny to get in and he&apos;ll drive her home; Jenny is wearing no protective rain clothing. Caring nothing about herself right now,Jenny laces into her father,taking out all her long pent-up frustration at Jason having left Robin in the first place,out on him. She gloats when Jason mentions that Chloe,frightened for her own life,has ran home to her mother,abandoning Jason. Jenny cruelly tells her father that she feels like an orphan before hailing a cab and riding off.The Beiderman family arrives at the Ark cave. As everyone on the bus debarks and starts to be ushered into the cave facilities,Leo suddenly stops. His parents turn around and Leo grimly announces he is going back for Sarah. He is determined in this over his mother&apos;s frantic protests. Don pulls off his watch and rings so Leo will have something to trade. They tearfully hug him before he sets off in pursuit of Sarah.Jason goes to see Jenny at the MSNBC offices. He tells her he&apos;s leaving Washington,but he has something for her; proof she isn&apos;t an orphan. He&apos;s brought several photographs taken at the family beach side house when Jenny was a child. Jason is holding her on his shoulders. Robin isn&apos;t in the photographs because she took the photos with her camera. It was a beautiful,happy day. Jenny seems nostalgic about the pictures but protests she was only 5 years old when the photos were taken,so she couldn&apos;t be expected to remember the day in question. Jason gives Jenny the photos to keep and says goodbye emotionally.Leo has gotten himself a ride with a number of individuals in the loft of a private truck heading back to Virginia Beach. They are listening to a radio broadcast; the Titan missile strike has just been launched at the two comets,that are now 14 hours away from impact. Jenny goes on the air for a news report to cover the missile strike. The comet will interfere with visual tracking,so once again the country must sit and wait until military radar can see if the comets have been pushed sufficiently off course to miss direct impact.Cut to President Beck at the Oval Office to deliver the results. For the first time,Beck is wearing only a pullover shirt and sweater; no dress shirt; tie,or suitcoat. The missiles have failed to deflect the comets off course. Earth has exhausted all options to prevent direct impact,and massive casualties are now inevitable. Beck delivers the dire statistics forecast for the impact:Beiderman,the smaller fragment of the comet,will impact at 4:37 Eastern Daylight Time,striking in the Atlantic Ocean a short distance off of Cape Hatteras. A massive tsunami will be formed,racing toward the US Eastern Seaboard faster than the speed of sound. As it approaches the shallower waters off the coastline,it will slow somewhat,but wave height will build up to several thousand feet. All settlements on the east coast,including the megalopolis cities of New York,Boston,Philadelphia,Washington,Atlanta and Miami,will be wiped out and destroyed. Beck tells everyone in these cities that have any means of hurrying westward,to leave immediately.The main body of the comet,Wolf,will strike land in Western Canada several hours later. This will be a full Extinction Level Event. Within two days after impact,dust and debris will fill the sky and create an effect similar to a &apos;nuclear winter&apos; that will make the skies dark for two years. Without sunlight reaching Earth&apos;s surface,all plant life will die,followed by all animal life.But on board the Messiah,Captain Tanner has come up with one last option. He calls the crew together to explain his plan. They can do nothing about the Beiderman fragment,but he believes they can still stop the main Wolf comet and give Earth hope for survival. Outgassing has created a very large fissure vent in the comet&apos;s surface leading well into its interior. As the comet draws closer to Earth,the sun will melt ice and widen the hole further. The Messiah has four nuclear warheads remaining. If they can get these warheads into that Vent,the comet should be blown into fragments far too small to wreak the kind of catastrophic damage that the intact comet would cause. The crew has to get close enough to Earth to reach Houston Mission Control and get the manual arming codes for the remaining warheads,in order to synchronize the bomb timers properly.Tulchinsky and Simon know that the Messiah is dangerously low on both life-support and remaining propellent fuel. It is not likely they can get into the cargo bay,or properly maneuver the Messiah for a second landing on the comet surface... much less get back off the surface once the warheads are planted.Fish&apos;s silence and grim expression,however,show that none of these are factors in his plan. It is a suicide mission; the Messiah making a kamikaze run into the comet&apos;s interior and detonating the warheads. All of the crew will perish. The crew is grim at this reality,but all quickly accept their pending fate. The Messiah finally gets close enough to Earth to raise Houston Mission Control on audio. Fish briefly fills Hefter in and tells him to get the arming codes for the remaining nuclear warheads.At the MSNBC news offices,final evacuations are underway. But there are seven people left in Caley&apos;s news team... and the last helicopter only has room for seven. As one of these must be the pilot,one of the news crew must be left behind for the helicopter to drop the others off on high ground in West Virginia before transporting Jenny to the Ark. Without any proper alternative means of deciding who must be left behind,straws are drawn. Beth draws the short stick,and quietly picks up her preschool-aged daughter,hoping for the best on the roads.Leo has acquired a bicycle and arrives at the Hotchner house. The Hotchner family has evacuated,leaving their dog behind. Rushing to the garage,Leo manages to locate the key to unlock the motorbike. He takes it to search the highways to find Sarah. The panicked rush to get out of the city has brought traffic to a near standstill reaching for miles.The news crew is rushing to board the helicopter. Jenny pauses to grab something from her desk. As she hurries to rejoin the remaining crew,they pass by the nursery. Beth is sitting there with her daughter Caitlin. Beth has realized the likelihood of successfully getting out of danger was very low with the frantic rush. She has resigned herself to her fate and gone to the nursery,hoping to spend her last few minutes holding and playing with Caitlin. Despite the frantic shouts of the other crew,Jenny simply stares at Beth for a long minute. Suddenly she grabs Caitlin out of Beth&apos;s arms and rushes madly for the helicopter. Beth rushes in anguish after her.But on the roof,Jenny thrusts Caitlin back into her mother&apos;s arms and announces that Beth is getting on the helicopter in Jenny&apos;s place. Nobody can dissuade her from this; she refuses to let Caitlin and Beth die. Everyone stares in amazement,knowing that Jenny is giving up her very life... but they have no time to debate the issue. Beth and Caitlin are ushered aboard the helicopter and it takes off,leaving Jenny behind. As she stands alone on the rooftop,Jenny gazes at what she took from her desk... it&apos;s the photos Jason gave her.Racing down the highway,Leo continues his search for Sarah. It is she and her parents who spot him first,calling out to him and honking. Chuck decides this time there will be no further arguing. He half carries,half-drags Sarah over to the motorbike,physically picking her up and putting her on the seat behind Leo. He puts a motorcycle helmet on Sarah&apos;s head as Vicky works feverishly to attach a baby harness to Sarah&apos;s chest and slip the baby into it. Chuck tells Leo to hurry off and save himself,Sarah and the baby,getting to high ground. This time he and Vicky turn a deaf ear to Sarah&apos;s anguished cries of protest. As Leo races off,Vicky bursts into tears and Chuck hugs her.Jenny,meanwhile,is shown pulling up to a beach side house... her family&apos;s house. She knows that Jason has gone here to spend his last moments before the tsunami strikes. She finds him on the beach,calmly staring out at the ocean. Saying that she lied to Jason about not remembering the day the photos were taken,Jenny finally makes peace and reconciles with her father. She hugs him and snuggles close,still frightened of her own impending death despite the decision she made to give her life up.Time has run out. The Beiderman comet fragment breaks Earth&apos;s atmosphere and rushes for impact. Everyone for miles can see it race out past the coastline before it plunges deep into the Atlantic Ocean. A titanic mushroom cloud roars upward and outward from the point of impact. The skies turn dark; birds tossed helplessly about in the air as the tsunami begins to race inexorably toward the eastern coast. At the Lerner beach house,Jenny gives a brief sob of fear before Jason pulls her head against his chest and closes his eyes. The tsunami strikes the coastline and begins its run of devastation. We&apos;re treated to the obligatory scenario of New York City being destroyed; the final shot showing the city immersed under water save for the very tops of the World Trade Center; the broken-off head of the Statue of Liberty bouncing like a dropped basketball down Wall Street.On the Virginia coast,people have abandoned their cars,racing pell-mell about in all directions,screaming frantically in a mad rush for higher ground. A few simply stand outside their cars and wait to perish. Among them are Chuck and Vicky Hotchner,holding and stroking each other for a final moment of comfort. Leo and Sarah are part of a small crowd that have gotten off the road,racing for higher ground among the hills.The Messiah has made final preparations for their interception of the Wolf Comet. The crew members have asked for their families to be brought to the Mission Control Center in Houston so they can say final goodbyes. Baker&apos;s husband and daughter,and Simon&apos;s fiancée are on standby. But Commander Monash&apos;s wife is still en route and hasn&apos;t arrived yet... and Fish&apos;s two sons were on active Naval duty and couldn&apos;t be reached. Accepting this,Fish gives a quiet prayer to his late wife,saying he&apos;s coming home to her at last.Baker and Simon say their final goodbyes tearfully. Transmission is just about to be terminated when officers come rushing to the control room with Mariette Monash in tow. She reaches the control room in the nick of time,holding her baby son,who she&apos;s named Oren in her husband&apos;s honor. Commander Monash,although still blind,can hear Mariette and Oren Jr. He gives them an emotional farewell as Col. Tulchinsky sets the warhead timers and Baker and Fish calculate trajectory for the final interception run. They say farewell to each other; Baker closing her eyes and Simon closing his as Captain Tanner flies the Messiah through the vent into the comet&apos;s interior. The warheads detonate,shattering the Wolf comet into millions of tiny fragments. Leo,Sarah,and Sarah&apos;s baby sister are among a group that have gotten to the top of the highest hill they could find,barely escaping the tsunami. They watch as the shattered fragments create a firework-like light show in the sky.Deep Impact closes with President Beck delivering an impassioned speech to a huge crowd in Washington D.C. after the waters of the Atlantic Ocean have receded and settled back into the ocean basin. Acknowledging the incalculable losses of lives in America,South America,Europe and Africa,President Beck tells his people that they must remember those who died for them,and carry on with their rebuilding of the human way of life. The camera pans out for the final shot showing the U.S. Capitol building under reconstruction as the people gathered there cheer.</Plot>

        <Plot>The movie starts off with archive black-and-white footage of the Nazi&apos;s atrocities on the Jews across Europe. The focus shifts to West Belarus,where Nazi SS soldiers,under the command of Bernicki,the Belarussian Police Captain,are busy &quot;sanitizing&quot; a village,killing half the people and abducting the rest. Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) and his brother,Asael (Jamie Bell),watch helplessly from the forest. Once the Germans have left,they run to the village and are devastated to find their father dead. They go to their house and find their youngest brother,Aron (George MacKay),cowering under the floorboards in the closet. They take him with them to the forest.In the Lipiczanska Forest,Zus tells a weeping Asael to get a hold of himself. As they sleep,their eldest brother,Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig),walks up to them and wakes them up. He first admonishes Asael for not being alert,then embraces him and Aron emotionally. Zus and Tuvia have a rather curt reunion. As they walk into the forest,Zus tells Tuvia that his wife and child are hiding in a village. At night,they discuss their options. The police are after them,however they are safe in the woods. They talk about Bernicki. A friend,Koscik has a gun which they can borrow. Next morning,Aron stumbles across some other Jewish refugees in the forest. He brings them back to his brothers. One of them is a young child,mortally wounded. Unfortunately,they can&apos;t save her. As her parents grieve,Zus tells Tuvia that they can&apos;t support these people. Tuvia says he&apos;ll ask Koscik for food and his pistol.In the nearby village,Konstanty &apos;Koscik&apos; Kozlowski,their friend and a secret Jew-sympathizer,lets Tuvia inside and gives him food,drink and his pistol,with only 4 bullets. Seeing a police car coming towards the house,Koscik hides Tuvia in the barn,along with some other Jews. It&apos;s Bernicki and his sons,who Koscik welcomes warmly. Bernicki talks about his Jew-hunting exploits. Bernicki talks about having killed the Bielskis&apos; father and is now after the sons. He tells Koscik to keep his eyes open and leaves. After they&apos;re gone,Koscik gives Tuvia food and drink and asks him to take the Jews from his barn. Tuvia confirms that Bernicki and his sons were responsible for his parent&apos;s deaths. He then takes the other Jews and goes into the forest.As they walk into the forest,one of the Jews,an elderly man named Shamon Haretz,Tuvia&apos;s old school-teacher,talks to him about his experiences. Tuvia brushes him off. At the campsite,the food is being passed around,with each person taking a small morsel so the others can have some. Zus is upset that Tuvia brought more mouths to feed. Tuvia tells him that it was Bernicki who killed their parents. That night,he goes to Bernicki&apos;s house,where he is having dinner with his wife and two sons. Tuvia bursts inside and holds them at gunpoint. He asks them if he knows who he is and why he&apos;s there. Terrified,Bernicki says he did as ordered. Tuvia orders him to his knees. Bernicki&apos;s sons jump up to their father&apos;s aid,but Tuvia shoots them dead. He then shoots Bernicki dead. Bernicki&apos;s hysterical wife pleads with Tuvia to kill her as well. Leaving her alive and grief-stricken,he leaves.The next morning,Tuvia tells Zus he killed Bernicki and his sons. They decide to move deeper into the woods. Tuvia brings over more Jews,much to Zus&apos; displeasure. One of them is Isaac Malbin (Mark Feuerstein). The refugees start building makeshift houses in the woods. After almost hitting Zus with a log,Isaac confesses that he&apos;s an intellectual,not a carpenter. A refugee introduces Tuvia to his &quot;forest wife&quot;. Tuvia congratulates them,a bit unsurely. Just then,two men burst into the scene,one of them holding a rifle,while the other demands food. Zus gets confrontational,despite being unarmed. He dares the man to shoot him,a Jew. When the two hear that they are Jews,they say they&apos;re Peretz and Jacov,from Zus&apos; village. Almost all the people in the village are dead,including Zus&apos; wife and child. Zus is devastated and grieves for his wife and child. He starts to hit his head against a tree trunk,but Tuvia grabs him and holds him,while he cries.Later,Peretz asks which Otriad (armed brigade) they are. Asael replies the &quot;Bielski Otriad&quot;. Peretz tells them that there is a Russian Otriad,which sabotages railways and kills Germans. Zus tells them,if they want to kill Germans,to follow him. Tuvia tries to dissuade him,but he&apos;s resolute. Reluctantly,Tuvia goes with the small group. They attack a town that supported the Nazis,killing a few people. They then attack a German motorcyclist,killing him and stripping him of his weapons. A German jeep comes down the road. The Bielskis hide along the road and wait. The jeep stops nearby seeing the fallen motorcycle. One of the Germans goes to the side of the road to relieve himself and does so right on Zus. Enraged,Zus stabs him to death,while the others attack the jeep. One tries to run,but gets gunned down by Asael. Zus picks up the machine gun of the guy he killed and unloads it on the jeep&apos;s occupants,killing them all. As they scour the jeep for weapons and food,a German truck comes down the road. Jacov is shot dead,while Peretz is injured. Asael takes to his heels,chased by German soldiers,while Zus and Tuvia take cover,watching helplessly as their brother sprints away,dodging German fire. They manage to shoot out the truck&apos;s spotlight,but find themselves outgunned. They have no choice but to retreat,leaving Asael to his fate.At the camp,Tuvia is furious at Zus. Food is dangerously low. Peretz is dead from his injuries. Shamon is upset that they didn&apos;t bring back any food. He quotes from the Talmud,saying that if they save a life,they must take responsibility for it. Suddenly,an armed man walks into the camp. Zus is irate that the man keeping watch didn&apos;t see him. He punches the man and says he should be killed,but Tuvia will have none of it. He&apos;s still angry at Zus and holds him responsible for Asael&apos;s fate. The man,Ben Zion Gulkowitz,tells Tuvia that he&apos;s from a village,where everyone was murdered,but he managed to escape. People start to cry and argue about their predicament. Tuvia yells out that they all have to live together or they&apos;ll all go against each other. He tells Zus that they can&apos;t go killing Germans and can&apos;t afford to lose more people. They will go to villages for food and take only what is offered to them. Their revenge is to live. They may be hunted like animals,but they won&apos;t become animals. If they should die,then it&apos;ll be as human beings.Tuvia,Zus and Ben Zion go to Koscik&apos;s house and find his body hanging from his barn. He&apos;s been beaten badly and has a sign &quot;Jew Lover&quot; hung around his neck. They dig a grave for him. Koscik&apos;s wife shows them a secret cellar under a haystack. They find Asael hiding there. They have a happy reunion. They find rifles hidden in the barn. They also find two Jewish ladies in the cellar. The older one is Bella and the younger one is Chaya. Zus is a bit taken in by Bella. At the campsite,Shamon and Isaac engage in an intellectual debate,as they work. Tuvia notices that Asael&apos;s shy interest in Chaya and encourages him to talk to her. He tells Asael to accompany Zus on the next expedition and to ensure that no one is killed.Zus,Asael and Ben Zion waylay a milkman,Kissely,on the road. They ask for his milk. He pleads that the Germans will kill him if he doesn&apos;t meet his quota. They only take half of his milk,but Zus also takes the man&apos;s coat. At the campsite,they are welcomed with glee. One of the men,Arkady Lubczanski,takes an interest in Chaya. He tries to force her to become his forest wife,but she declines politely. Ben Zion tells Tuvia that new refugees have arrived from Novogroduk. Bad news is,Tuvia&apos;s wife is dead. Though saddened,Tuvia maintains his composure. Bella goes to Zus and asks if she can be his forest wife,which he willingly accepts.Aron sees some Belarussian policemen and German soldiers,being led to the campsite by Kissely. He runs back to the camp to report. Tuvia orders that the people evacuate the camp immediately,while a few people remain behind to stave off the attackers. Once the refugees are relatively safe,Tuvia and the fighters take cover behind trees,overlooking a small rivulet. When the policemen and soldiers come to the rivulet,the partisans fire at them,injuring a few. The soldiers and Kissely take cover behind trees as well. They yell at each other. The leader of the soldiers tells them to hand over the Bielskis and the rest can go free. Tuvia asks the leader why he,a Belarussian,works for the Germans. Kissely yells out to survive,but Zus shoots him in the arm. The partisans shoot at the attackers,forcing them to retreat. When they&apos;re gone,Zus angrily tells Tuvia that he should have killed the milkman before and that it&apos;s his fault that they now have to relocate. The refugees walk past a field into another section of the woods.As Tuvia and Zus survey the woods,they are confronted by a group of Russian partisans. Tuvia tells them that they&apos;re from the Bielski Otriad and they want to see their commander. They are taken to the Russian partisans&apos; camp,where they meet Viktor Panchenko,leader of the October Otriad. Panchenko accuses them of stealing from villages loyal to them. Tuvia responds that when they (October Otriad) take food,it is support,but when the Bielskis do it,it is stealing. He tells Panchenko that they fight a common enemy. Though he doesn&apos;t believe Jews can fight,Panchenko tells them to send him their best fighters.Back at the new campsite,the refugees are doing their best to set up a camp,before winter sets in. A new bunch of refugees is being escorted inside. One of them,Yitzchak Shulman,tells Tuvia that he is from the Baranovichi ghetto. The Germans will kill everyone if anyone is found missing. Chaya&apos;s parents are also inside the ghetto. She pleads with Asael to do something to get them out. Tuvia decides to go to the ghetto to save all the Jews inside from imminent massacre. Zus is skeptical. They argue for a while,culminating in a fistfight,which ends with Tuvia just about restraining himself from bashing Zus&apos; head in with a rock. Tuvia walks away. Zus takes Ben Zion and some other fighters to the Russian partisan camp. Asael stays behind.Tuvia and Asael sneak into the Baranovichi ghetto and talk to the elders there,regarding their escape. The elders are incredulous that the Germans would kill all of them just like that. Tuvia promises to keep all of them safe in the woods. One by one,all the people in the ghetto agree to go to the woods,including Lilka Ticktin (Alexa Davalos). That night,under cover of darkness,Tuvia and Asael get the Jews out of the ghetto. When they reach the camp,they are asked to surrender their valuables,which can be traded for food and weapons. Chaya has a happy reunion with her parents. Isaac and Shamon ask about people who know useful trades,like carpentry. Tuvia gets on his horse and gives a speech. He says that everyone must work,women will learn to fight alongside men,pregnancies are forbidden. They will rebuild their lives.Bella encourages Asael to propose to Chaya. He does so awkwardly and she readily accepts. They are married just as winter starts. As this happens,the October Otriad,assisted by Zus and his fighters,attacks a German convoy,killing everyone on board. Panchenko is impressed by Zus&apos; ruthlessness.Soon,winter sets in. Food supplies are low and people are cold and starving. Tuvia,left with no other choice,shoots his horse dead,so the people can eat. At suppertime,the lines get unruly as horse meat (though considered non-kosher) is served. Tuvia enters a cabin to warm himself and sees Lilka inside. She&apos;s on her way out for her first food mission. He gives her his coat and his pistol,just in case. Arkady comes in and pokes fun at Tuvia. A woman informs Tuvia about sickness that is spreading through the colony. Lilka,having got a sack of food,encounters a wolf on the way back. It attacks her,but she manages to kill it. She takes the wolf and the sack back to the camp. At the camp,the sickness is found to be typhus. The Russian partisans have ampicillin,but won&apos;t part with it.Tuvia goes to the Russian partisan camp to ask for ampicillin. Panchenko is strategising with Zus about a transmitter at Police HQ,which has caused them much trouble. That transmitter has to be silenced. Tuvia comes to Panchenko and asks for ampicillin. Panchenko refuses,but Tuvia insists. Zus calms the situation down,by suggesting they hit a police station and take out the transmitter there. Outside the police station,Zus sees that Tuvia&apos;s also been affected by typhus. He tells him to wait in the car,while he,Ben Zion and another man attack the station. The attack is a success - the transmitter is destroyed and the ampicillin is stolen - but Ben Zion and the other man die,while Zus is wounded. He and Tuvia drive back. Tuvia asks Zus to come back to the camp,but Zus declines.As the funerals for Ben Zion and the other man are underway,Tuvia sits in his cabin,coughing uncontrollably. The next day,Arkady demands more food from Chaya,during lunchtime. He tries to take more,but Asael pushes him away. They draw their knives and they are restrained by the others. Tuvia breaks it up and tells them,as punishment,Arkady and Asael get only half rations. He walks away,coughing. Asael confronts him regarding rumours about him being power-hungry and corrupt,and that he is no longer fit to lead them. The next day,during lunchtime,as Tuvia sits coughing badly in his cabin,Arkady has pretty much taken over. He and his cronies have beaten up Asael and have taken the lion&apos;s share of food rations for themselves. Tuvia,hearing all this,steels himself and gets up. He walks outside and sees Arkady and his cronies sitting at a table,being served by Chaya. Tuvia sees Asael&apos;s bruised face and confronts Arkady. Arkady tells him it&apos;s the new policy that fighters get better food. Tuvia is no longer the leader. As Arkady laughs derisively,Tuvia shoots him dead. He orders the cronies to obey him. Anyone who wants to leave can do so. No one argues and he&apos;s the leader again.He gets better under Lilka&apos;s care. Soon,the sun comes out and it&apos;s springtime. The ice melts and spirits are lifted considerably. One of the women,Tamara,reveals to Lilka that she&apos;s pregnant and the baby could come anytime soon. She is terrified of what Tuvia would do when he finds out. Lilka comforts her,saying he&apos;ll understand. Tamara tells her that she was raped by a German soldier. When the baby is born,Tuvia hears the cries and finds it in a cabin with Lilka and other women. He is angry and confronts Lilka about it. He wants Tamara and the father to leave,but Lilka tells him Tamara was raped. She reminds him of his own words - to not become animals. He agrees. Happily,she kisses him. They share a passionate kiss.Aron sees a German convoy passing by. Back at the camp,the lone surviving soldier of a partisan raid is dragged into camp. The terrified German is paraded before the partisans. They&apos;ve also found a pouch containing information about an attack on the camp in two days. The German pleads for his life,saying he has a wife and kids. That just enrages the partisans even more,as they&apos;ve lost everything. They proceed to beat the German to death. While Shamon and Isaac try to stop them,Tuvia watches indifferently.The next day,Panchenko tells Zus that they&apos;re leaving the forest as the Germans are going to attack. The Bielski partisans will be sacrificed to the Russian partisans can escape. Zus is upset and tries to protest,but Panchenko says that if he tries to desert,he&apos;ll be shot.At the Bielski camp,they notice a German scout plane overhead. Tuvia orders everyone to evacuate the camp. Just as the people start to evacuate the camp,a couple of Luftwaffe planes fly towards them. Tuvia yells for everyone to take cover. The planes dive-bomb the camp,killing many. A bomb hits close to Tuvia,leaving him dazed and blinded for a while. Asael orders the fighters to arms,as German soldiers are expected to attack soon. The rest of the people are to evacuate. Tuvia is to lead the refugees away,while Asael stays back to fight. The Germans attack,killing all the fighters,except Asael,who manages to escape barely. However,they managed to stave off the Germans long enough for the refugees to make good their escape.Tuvia and the refugees come up on a large marshland. Unsure of whether Asael is alive or not,Tuvia finds himself unable to decide whether to stay or go. Asael runs up and tells them that the troops are behind them. They should cross the marsh if they are to survive. Gathering rope and everyone&apos;s belt,they make a long enough chain,so they can go through the marsh. They start to wade through the muddy water warily. Soon,they make it to the other side of the woods. Shamon,however,is in bad shape. He thanks Tuvia for having saved them and thanks God. He dies shortly after.Suddenly,they find themselves being attacked by a tank and a company of German troops. In the ensuing battle,a number of partisans are killed. Tuvia takes Isaac and they flank around to the rear of the attackers. They kill a machine gun squad and commandeer the machine gun,opening fire on the troops,killing many. However,they are discovered and the tank starts to slowly turn its turret towards them,as the troops fire at them. As the turret stops,they abandon the machine gun and take cover behind the trees,as the Germans fire incessantly at them. Isaac grabs hold of a potato-masher grenade,arms it,looks one last time at Tuvia and runs towards the tank. However,he doesn&apos;t get more than twenty yards,as he&apos;s shot dead by the troops. The grenade blows up near him. Just as things look really bad for Tuvia,the Germans are ambushed from behind by Zus&apos; men. After killing many Germans,Zus jumps on the tank,killing the gunner and throwing in a grenade. The tank implodes. The partisans complete cleaning up the remaining Germans. Tuvia comes out of cover and orders everyone into the forest. They strip the dead of their weapons. Zus and Bella reunite. Tuvia and Zus,after a long wordless encounter,embrace each other emotionally,as Asael watches with a smile. They all walk into the woods.We are informed that they lived in the forest for two years. Their number grew to 1200. Asael died in action and never saw his and Chaya&apos;s child. Zus and Tuvia emigrated to New York and started a trucking business. Tuvia and Lilka remained married for the rest of their lives. The Bielskis never sought recognition for their actions.</Plot>

        <Plot>John McClane,a detective with the New York City Police Department,arrives in Los Angeles to attempt a Christmas reunion and reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly,who is attending a party thrown by her employer,the Nakatomi Corporation at its still-unfinished American branch office headquarters,the high-rise Nakatomi Plaza. When McClane refreshes himself from the flight in Holly&apos;s corporate room,they have an argument over the use of her maiden name,Gennero,but Holly is called away.As the party continues,a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber seize the building and hold the partygoers as hostages in exchange for terrorist operatives in prison. In the confusion,McClane was able to disappear unnoticed into the building&apos;s maintenance areas,and learns that Gruber is actually using the hostage situation as a cover to steal $640 million in bearer bonds stored in the building&apos;s vault. McClane is unable to stop Gruber from executing Joe Takagi,Holly&apos;s boss,when he refuses to hand over the vault&apos;s combination.McClane attempts to alert the local police by setting off the fire alarm,and Gruber&apos;s men come after him. McClane kills them,securing one of their radios,a quantity of C4 explosives and all the crucial detonators which one of Gruber&apos;s men was setting into prepared explosives. Gruber and his men listen over the radio as McClane contacts the Los Angeles Police Department. Officer Al Powell arrives to check the building,finds nothing amiss and drives off,but McClane gets his attention by dropping one of the corpses onto Powell&apos;s patrol vehicle. The situation rapidly escalates,and the SWAT team arrives to storm the building. McClane attempts to get Powell to stop the SWAT team from walking into a trap,but Powell cannot convince his superiors. The SWAT team is repelled,the SWAT armoured vehicle is disabled by a rocket launcher,and the police are out-gunned by the firepower of the terrorists. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from.As the remainder of Gruber&apos;s men attempt to find McClane and the detonators,one of the hostages betrays McClane&apos;s identity to Gruber. Gruber uses the radio to contact McClane,and demands that McClane return the detonators or else he would shoot one of the hostages. McClane refuses,and Gruber kills the man who had sold out McClane&apos;s identity,to the horror of the police force who heard everything on radio. McClane continues to keep moving through the building to try to learn Gruber&apos;s plans. McClane and Gruber accidentally meet but Gruber gains McClane&apos;s trust by passing himself off as an escaped hostage. But then Gruber&apos;s identity is discovered as he threatens to shoot McClane. When Gruber&apos;s men arrive,McClane flees,dropping the detonators.&#x0A;The FBI arrives and takes control of the situation. They shut off the building&apos;s power while they plan a helicopter raid onto the roof. However,Gruber had planned for the FBI&apos;s predictability - disconnecting the power opened the final electromagnetic lock on the vault and gave him access to the bonds. He has used the recovered detonators to rig the helipad on the building&apos;s roof with explosives,knowing the FBI would attempt a sneak gunship attack on the building. After the FBI informs Gruber that his demands have been met,Gruber&apos;s men force the hostages to the roof to be killed by the explosions,so they could escape in the confusion. McClane is able to get them back inside safely,but the FBI helicopter shoots at him,believing he&apos;s one of the terrorists. The helipad explodes,the helicopter is destroyed and the two head FBI agents are killed in the explosion.Gruber has discovered from an over-eager reporter&apos;s investigative newscast that Holly Gennero is McClane&apos;s wife. He holds her hostage to prevent McClane from interfering in his getaway. McClane,down to his last two bullets,is able to lull Gruber into a trap,killing the last remaining terrorist and wounding Gruber,who falls backwards and out of the building through a window. Gruber manages to hang onto Holly&apos;s wristwatch,his weight dragging her out the window as well. McClane is able to unstrap the watch and lets Gruber fall to his death. Meanwhile,Theo,Gruber&apos;s technological assistant,is detained by McClane&apos;s limo driver,Argyle,after collecting the bonds. McClane and Holly leave the building together,and meet Officer Powell face to face for the first time. Powell had previously confessed to McClane that he had not fired a gun since he accidentally shot a child years ago. One of the terrorists comes out behind McClane and Holly with a gun,but Powell draws and shoots him before he can harm McClane and Holly. When the overzealous reporter attempts to interview them as they are leaving the scene,Holly punches him in the face. McClane and Holly take off in Argyle&apos;s limo as the building is secured by the police.</Plot>

        <Plot>When a bomb explodes at the Bonwit Teller department store,a man calling himself &quot;Simon&quot; phones Major Case Unit Inspector Walter Cobb at the police station and claims responsibility for the bomb. He orders suspended police officer Lt. John McClane to walk through the middle of Harlem,in his underwear,wearing a sandwich board with the slogan &quot;I hate Niggers&quot; on it. McClane is driven there by Cobb and three other officers. Harlem electrician Zeus Carver spots McClane and tries to get him off the street before he is killed,but a gang of black youths attacks McClane and Carver,who barely escape. Returning to the station,McClane and Carver learn that Simon is likely in possession of several gallons of a bio-chemical agent explosive stolen the night before. Simon calls the station again and demands McClane and Carver put themselves through a series of &quot;games&quot; to prevent any more explosions. McClane is forced to lie to Carver to gain his trust.&#x0A;One of Simon&apos;s games require McClane and Carver to travel to the Wall Street subway station,over 70 blocks away,within 30 minutes to stop a bomb on it. Though McClane manages to get aboard the train,identify the bomb,and throw it off the train car,Simon still ignites the bomb,ravaging much of the station but without any fatalities thanks to McClane and Carver. The two are met by FBI agents that have identified Simon as Simon &quot;Peter&quot; Gruber,the brother of Hans Gruber,who was killed by McClane in the first film,and several of his cohorts. During the debriefing,Simon calls into the group and warns that another bomb has been planted in one of New York&apos;s City schools,and that any police radio could set it off. As McClane and Carver are forced to complete more games to identify the school,the police organize a massive search of every school,forcing the teams to rely on telephone communications.&#x0A;McClane,while playing at Simon&apos;s games,realizes that something is wrong and returns to Wall Street while Carver continues to follow Simon&apos;s instructions. McClane finds Simon&apos;s men have raided the Federal Reserve Bank through the ruined subway system,making off with $140 billion of gold bullion from the vault,hauling it away in dump trucks. McClane attempts to follow the dump trucks through the aqueduct,but Simon destroys a cofferdam and floods the tunnel; McClane escapes and regroups with Carver. They continue to follow the dump trucks to a tanker,and make a daring attempt to board it,but are quickly caught. At the same time that the police attempt to evacuate the school they think the bomb is in,McClane and Carver find that Simon has instead used the rest of the explosive to rig the tanker to explode,which would send the gold to the bottom of the sea. After Simon leaves,McClane and Carver escape the doomed tanker just before the bomb is detonated.&#x0A;As they regroup with the police and have their wounds tended to,McClane reveals that there was no gold on the ship,as it was replaced with scrap metal,and Simon has likely gotten away. Carver prompts McClane to call his estranged wife Holly,but while on line with her,discovers that an aspirin bottle given to him by Simon identifies a nearby border town in Quebec. McClane leads a raid along with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on a warehouse where Simon and his men have started to distribute the gold. Simon attempts to escape on a helicopter and shoot down McClane,but McClane is able to fire upon a power line,severing it onto the helicopter and destroying it. Carver joins McClane and convinces him to finish his call to Holly at a nearby pay phone.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens with a documentary-style series of interviews that introduce the story: twenty years prior,an alien ship arrives above Johannesburg,South Africa. It hovers above the city for three months without any contact; eventually humans take the initiative and cut into the ship. They discover a large group of aliens who are malnourished and sick. The aliens are later assessed as being &quot;workers&quot;,with their leadership mysteriously missing (it is hypothesized that a plague may have wiped out all of the leadership-caste). Grainy footage shows part of the ship (supposedly a command module) falling to Earth,but nobody has been able to find it,leaving the ship still hovering but inoperable.The creatures are given permission to leave their craft and live on Earth but are housed in a squalorous government camp. The alien race&apos;s true name is never learned; they are primarily referred to as &quot;prawns&quot;,a derogatory term referring to the bottom-feeding sea creature they resemble or,more rarely,&quot;non-humans&quot;. Overcrowding and militarization eventually turn the area into a slum known as District 9. A massive black market is set up between the aliens and a group of Nigerians primarily led by Mumbo,a paralyzed warlord. In addition to inter-species prostitution,the Nigerians exchange canned cat food for alien weapons,of which the cat food has a similar effect to catnip on the aliens.The present story takes place in 2010. Patience over the alien situation among the human population of Johannesburg has run out and control over them has been contracted to Multi-National United (MNU),a private company that shows little regard for the aliens&apos; welfare. MNU&apos;s actual agenda is their interest in the aliens&apos; advanced weaponry,but its integration with alien biology makes it useless to humans.An MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley),is tasked with moving 1.8 million aliens to a new camp,District 10,located 240 km from Johannesburg,with help from private security forces working for MNU. MNU teams serving warrants for the relocation of the aliens find caches of contraband items,including weapons,in many alien shacks. Wikus himself oversees several inspections. In another shack,not far away,an alien named Christopher distills a mysterious black substance that has taken him 20 years to find the components for and stores it in a small black cylinder. While serving and eviction notice to Christopher,and searching his shack,Wikus finds the cylinder which squirts it&apos;s contents into his face. He becomes almost instantly nauseous and collects the device as evidence.Wikus returns to his office and grows increasingly ill throughout the day,the side-effects of the black fluid becoming more prominent. He returns home that evening and collapses at a surprise party in his house. He is rushed to a hospital where a doctor discovers his left arm has metamorphosed into that of a prawn. Wikus is taken into custody and a series of tests and experiments are performed on him; these reveal that his alien DNA allows him to operate alien weapons with both his human and alien hand. The scientists discover that his DNA is currently &quot;in balance&quot; with the alien DNA,which is gradually transforming him completely into a prawn. With the permission of Wikus&apos; ruthless father-in-law,they decide to harvest his body for biological material at this critical point,to have the greatest chance of replicating his ability to use alien technology in other humans later. To reduce any complications in harvesting,no anesthetic will be used. However,during the attempted vivisection Wikus escapes after overpowering his captors,and flees from MNU. He finds refuge in District 9.Wikus returns to the run-down shack of Christopher,who has a small son. It is hinted that Christopher might be a surviving member of the prawn leadership caste,as he shows much more knowledge of how alien technology works,possesses or at least found the command module,and interacts with MNU officials more articulately than other aliens. Although initially hostile towards Wikus,Christopher eventually agrees to help him reverse the transformation if Wikus will retrieve the fuel from MNU labs. Christopher promises to undo the mutation by getting Wikus aboard the mother ship hovering over Johannesburg,and shows Wikus the ship&apos;s command module,which has been hidden under his shack.Wikus steals some alien weaponry from Mumbo and his gang,with Mumbo vowing to capture Wikus and eat his mutated arm (his witch doctor believes this will give him the power to operate the alien weaponry). With Christopher&apos;s help they launch an assault on MNU and successfully retrieve the fuel sample. While there,Christopher discovers that MNU has been conducting horrific experiments on his people. Wikus and Christopher fight their way back to District 9 and Christopher begins preparations to leave. He tells Wikus that he must first return to his home world to seek help for his people before he can cure Wikus. Furious,Wikus knocks Christopher unconscious and powers up the ship himself. The MNU mercenaries target Wikus and destroy one of the command module&apos;s engines,causing it to crash land inside District 9.After Wikus is captured by MNU,a battle between the MNU mercenaries and Mumbo&apos;s gang breaks out. After a protracted firefight,the Nigerians capture Wikus. Just before Wikus&apos; arm is chopped off,Christopher&apos;s son activates several systems in the mothership,including the autopilot routine of a mechanized battle suit; it slaughters Mumbo and his men after they fire on it. Wikus enters the alien walker battle suit,and after initially attempting to flee,returns and rescues Christopher. Armed with a lightning cannon,tracking missiles,and a high-powered machine gun,Wikus begins to fight the MNU men. After being knocked over by an anti-tank sniper round,he convinces Christopher to return to the shuttle without him,over Christopher&apos;s objections. Christopher promises Wikus that he will return in three years to repair his body. Christopher then boards the shuttle and activates a tractor beam which returns the command module to the mother ship.Wikus is shot in the back and the walker suit ejects him. Wikus,heavily wounded,begins dragging himself away from Koobus Venter,the leader (and sole survivor) of an MNU squad,but is quickly caught. As he prepares to shoot Wikus,other prawns appear,attacking and dismembering Venter.The film concludes with another series of interviews and news broadcasts,providing human opinions on the events that unfolded. The aliens are successfully moved to District 10,which now has a population of 2.5 million and is growing. One of Wikus&apos; coworkers hacks MNU&apos;s database and publicly exposes their illegal genetic experiments. There are many differing theories on Wikus&apos; fate. Some people believe that he either left on the mother ship,is in hiding,was captured by MNU or a government agency. Some interviewees hypothesize that the aliens are planning to return with a full army and declare war on humanity. An interview with Wikus&apos; wife reveals a small metal rose was left on her doorstep (Wikus has earlier demonstrated his affection with handmade gifts). Her friends have told her that it could not have possibly been Wikus,but she appears unsure. In the final scene,an alien with a bandaged left arm is shown in a junk yard fashioning a rose out of scrap metal.</Plot>

        <Plot>Dragonheart begins with Bowen (Dennis Quaid),a Knight of the &quot;Old Code&quot; of honor,valor and chivalry,tutoring his young protege,Einon (Lee Oakes) in both swordplay and the values of a knight. Einon is the king&apos;s son and heir to the throne. The lesson,conducted amongst some old ruins,is interrupted by Brok (Brian Thompson),leader of the armies of King Freyne (Peter Hric). Brok tells Einon of a peasant rebellion,and King Freyne wants Einon to witness it being crushed. Einon rushes to the village where the fighting is taking place,forcing Bowen to follow to protect him. Einon thinks Bowen&apos;s blade will be the best on the battlefield,but Bowen warns Einon to learn the difference between battle and butchery,and only by doing so will he be a greater ruler than his father. Einon promises that he will be a greater ruler.(During the battle,a caption says the movie takes place in England in the year 984 A.D.)Bowen is separated from Einon when the youth rushes off as his father,who brazenly rode off alone to set fire to huts and homes,is surrounded by peasants in an ambush. Freyne is dismounted and killed. When the villagers disperse,Einon rushes from a hiding place and takes the crown off his father&apos;s head. Freyne,who isn&apos;t quite dead yet,grabs at Einon who struggles free,yelling,&quot;It&apos;s mine!&quot; In the confusion,a young girl (Sandra Kovacicova) wearing a bucket on her head as a helmet,falls off of the balcony of a smoking hut and knocks Einon into a spiked post which pierces through his chest,grievously wounding him. The girl takes off her helm to reveal long red hair. They look at each other for a moment,the girl remorseful and Einon with pain. Bowen rides in and grabs Einon,rushing him to the castle. Royal physicians prepare to work on saving Einon,who is crying in pain,but Einon&apos;s mother,Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie),orders them all out except for Bowen. As Aislinn examines her son&apos;s wound,Bowen says Einon is beyond all help. Aislinn looks at a small statue of a dragon and says,&quot;Not all.&quot;Aislinn,Bowen,and a small company of soldiers go to a cave in the mountains where Aislinn calls to a being of reverence. To the shock of everyone else,a dragon appears,though most of him is hidden in shadow. When he sees the severity of Einon&apos;s wound,he is reluctant to help and warns Aislinn the consequences of what must be done to save him. Aislinn assures the dragon that Einon is not like his father and vows to ensure that he grows up to be a fine leader and role model for his people,but the dragon insists that Einon swear to all this himself. Einon swears by the dragon just as he breathes his last. Bowen angrily shouts at the dragon but is reprimanded as the dragon opens a chest plate and removes half his heart,placing it in Einon&apos;s chest. He then seals the wound with a blast of fire. As Einon wakes up,he commands the boy to do as he promised. Aislinn kneels before the dragon in gratitude,and Bowen promises to repay the favor any way he can,any time in the future when the dragon might need him. On the way back down the mountain,Einon calls Brok to him and tells him that he will rebuild his father&apos;s castle.The rebellion is crushed and the peasants are all forced to provide hard labor to rebuild the castle. The rebel leader,Redbeard (Terry O&apos;Neill) and several of his best cohorts are brought before young Einon in chains. Einon decrees that their eyes should be burned out. Bowen interferes and breaks the restraints binding Redbeard and the peasant leaders,allowing them to flee. Einon berates Bowen for interefering but Bowen protests Einon&apos;s cruelty towards his subjects,reminding him of the Code. Einon replies that the king is above the Code. Angry,Bowen tells Einon that the king is even more bound to the Code than anyone. Outraged at Einon&apos;s sudden cruel demeanor,Bowen rushes to the dragon&apos;s cave,shouting that the dragon&apos;s &apos;gift&apos; corrupted Einon and that Bowen has decided on a new vow-- to spend the rest of his life hunting the dragon down to ultimately kill him.Twelve years later we encounter a traveling monk named Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite) spouting poetry and prose to himself to be written down. Suddenly,he sees a dragon fly past,with Bowen charging after it. He catches up to the dragon beyond the edge of a hill (we see grass,earth,and hay flying up). Brother Gibert sighs in sorrow as he sees Bowen&apos;s horse run over the hill riderless until,finally,Bowen emerges,victorious. Brother Gilbert praises Bowen on his bravery as a servant for King Einon,Lord Felton (Jason Isaacs),arrives to give Bowen the kingdom&apos;s gratitude. But Bowen wants the gold he was apparently promised for killing the dragon,insisting that despite his honor as a knight,he still has to eat and upkeep his horse and gear. Lord Felton scoffs at Bowen as having become a rogue mercenary only interested in money.Meanwhile Redbeard,now old,blind,and feeble,is working in a quarry,when his daughter,Kara (Dina Meyer) comes to bring him some water. The cup is shot out of his hand by a now-adult King Einon (David Thewlis),accompanied by Brok and Felton. Kara begs that Einon show some mercy on her father and to release him. Einon agrees to do so-- and shoots Redbeard through the heart with an arrow. Einon exclaims that death is a release,not a punishment. He rides off with Felton and Brok chuckling,leaving Kara to grieve.Brother Gilbert follows Bowen,seeking to write poetry about his deeds as a dragonslayer. Pausing to rest near a waterfall,they discover that behind this waterfall is a cave housing another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery). Bowen moves forward through the falls to kill the dragon,but it escapes and leads Bowen on a wild chase,taunting him along the way. Soon,they come to an empty field where they fight face-to-face. The dragon scoops Bowen into his mouth where Bowen stabs his sword into the dragon&apos;s palate. Both stuck,they come to an impasse and remain that way for a number of hours. Brother Gilbert,watching nearby and reciting more prose,eventually falls asleep. After some arguing,the dragon has had enough; he pushes Bowen out of his mouth and traps him under his claws. Instead of killing Bowen,the dragon offers an alternative which would be beneficial for both of them.The next day we see the dragon flying over a village,terrorizing the peasants. Bowen arrives and agrees to save the villagers for a price. He and the dragon stage a mock battle where Bowen appears to kill the dragon with a large spear projected from a bow. The dragon feigns a hit and falls into the river where he stealthily swims away. They meet later,Bowen counting his gold. He is satisfied with the new partnership but is wondering about his draconian partner,who claims to now be the last of his kind. The dragon admits he does long to die but is frightened at the prospect of losing his soul.We see Einon and his retinue enjoying a nightly feast in the castle; Queen Aislinn sits morosely nearby,alone and clearly distasteful at what Einon has become. As Einon lifts a silver flagon to drink,in its reflection he sees a figure crouched high in a window directly behind him. He moves quickly just as Kara,holding a knife and bent on killing Einon,crashes down onto the table. The guards drag Kara off to the dungeon as she kicks and screams of how Einon murdered her father. Aislinn glares at Einon who takes the knife and stabs it angrily into a roasted boar.Some time later,Einon goes down to the dungeon to see Kara. She is now grimy from the filth of the dungeon and long chains bolted into the wall are attached to heavy steel manacles around her wrists. Kara rushes at Einon only for the chains to stop her short. Einon recognizes the fire in Kara&apos;s eyes,and looking at her fiery red hair,realizes that Kara was the young girl who accidentally fell into him many years ago,thus the one responsible for the wound that required the dragon&apos;s gift to heal him. He tells her that he is indebted to her for this.The scene switches to Bowen and the dragon at their camp,Bowen has been calling the dragon simply &quot;dragon&quot; and the dragon decides he&apos;s tired of it since he has a name. Bowen asks what it is,though the dragon claims he couldn&apos;t possibly pronounce it. Still,he obliges to answer but is cut off as his shoulder flares red and he falls back,roaring in pain.The scene quickly switches to Einon&apos;s bedroom. He falls against a wall with a fresh wound on his shoulder (this implies the link between him and the dragon). Kara backs away from him,holding a knife. They are both dressed in sleeping clothes. Einon mocks Kara to hit more flesh,less cloth next time and forces her to his bed,grabbing the knife away from her. He offers her the chance to be his bride,an idea Kara finds repugnant. He leaves her in his room to think it over and walks away.Back at the camp,Bowen places a blanket over the dragon&apos;s wound who explains that it is merely something the just pops up every now and then. The dragon closes his eyes to sleep and wakes up some time later to see Bowen still awake. Bowen says that he&apos;s been thinking of a name for the dragon and offers to call him Draco,after the constellation,although it only means &apos;dragon&apos;. Despite that,the dragon is honored.Later still,Kara remains locked in Einon&apos;s bedroom alone,looking to escape,when a large stone in the floor suddenly slides aside and Aislinn appears. She tells Kara that she will lead her through a hidden tunnel so she can escape. Kara is grateful for the release,but Aislinn is gone before Kara can properly thank her.Once free,Kara goes to her home village looking to incite another rebellion against Einon. However,the villagers,remembering what happened last time,want none of it and pelt her with rotten vegetables. One of the senior villagers,Hewe (Wolf Christian),who aided Kara&apos;s father Redbeard in the previous rebellion and now without one of his eyes,is incensed at Kara. Before she can argue further,Draco appears and pretends to attack. Bowen arrives soon after,offering to rid the village of the nuisance for a price. Kara berates Bowen as a blackmailer who is no different than Einon. Needing to get Kara out of the way,Bowen slyly suggests that a maiden sacrifice to the dragon might get him to leave the people alone.The villagers waste no time tying Kara to a stake placed in a wagon for the dragon. Of course,Draco finds the idea of a sacrifice distasteful,and it turns out he is quite opposed to eating humans. In order to finish the scam,Draco grabs Kara and flies off,pretending to be appeased by the &apos;sacrifice&apos;. When Bowen chases after Draco to see where he&apos;s gone to,he finds him sitting at the waterfall where they first met singing pleasantly to Kara,who sits on a rock nearby. No longer at all afraid,Kara questions Draco&apos;s benign nature against his decision to attack her village. When Bowen arrives,she waves a dagger in his face to defend Draco,though she quickly realizes that they indeed work together.The scene is interrupted by Einon and a group of soldiers. Draco enters his cave,escaping notice. Einon does not fail to notice,however,that Bowen is in company of Kara,the woman he intends to marry. When Bowen tells Einon to leave them alone,Einon challenges him to battle. Bowen&apos;s swordplay skills are as sharp as ever but Einon proves to be a match for him. Bowen berates Einon for betraying the code and the vows he spoke. Einon retorts that he lied; as far as he was concerned,Bowen taught him to fight,nothing more. Bowen&apos;s spirit is broken at the realization that Einon was always as treacherous and malevolent as his father and that all he wanted was the absolute power of the king&apos;s crown. His concentration lapses and Einon defeats him,stabbing him in the chest. Einon pretends to leave Bowen merely wounded and when he turns back to throw a dagger at him,Draco lunges forward menacingly and pulls back his chest plate,revealing to a frightened Einon his half heart and an open target. Einon flees while Bowen angrily states that he had everything under control.Kara accompanies Bowen on the road,trying to talk him into leading a rebellion against Einon,but Bowen is too disillusioned to do so. Draco flies past him en route to another village that he and Bowen are planning to bilk out of its gold. At the village,the elder is counting out gold when Kara,disgusted at the scam,arrives to proclaim Bowen a fraud. But Brother Gilbert arrives to defend him as a great dragonslayer. Kara knows that Bowen and Draco are working together,but of course her claim is met with uproarious laughter and ridicule,Bowen laughing with the villagers to cover himself.Bowen and Draco carry out the routine with Kara and Brother Gilbert watching,but the scam goes wrong when the river Draco lands in after pretending to be killed is too shallow for him to swim away unseen. The villagers advance,intending to cut Draco up for meat to feed themselves. To save himself,Draco flies off,proving the scam. The villagers decide they will cut up and eat Bowen,Kara and Brother Gilbert instead. As they sit on Bowen&apos;s horse,surrounded,Draco grabs them and flies them all to Avalon,the legendary resting place of King Arthur.At Avalon,Draco tells the tale of how dragons must earn entry into their equivalent of heaven,and those who fail fade into oblivion. Draco is frightened that this fate now awaits him because of a sacrifice he made long ago that proved malevolent,despite his best intentions. He is the dragon that gave Einon half his heart and he did so knowing that Einon would betray all the vows he made. Desperate to redeem himself,he offers to return to the villages with Kara and help her start a new rebellion. Despondent and having lost faith in the Old Code,Bowen refuses. Later on,during a rainstorm,Bowen is brought out to a large courtyard surrounded by statues of kings past by the voice of Draco,muttering an old tenant. Bowen then sees a vision at the statue of King Arthur who recites the creed of the Old Code. Bowen repeats the words and is filled with a new sense of purpose,reminded of all that he once swore himself to. Draco appears,smiling,and shields Bowen from the rain with one of his wings.Back at Kara&apos;s home village,he tells the people that he is starting a war against Einon,and when they see that he has the support of a dragon,they are all moved to rebellion. The men are trained by Bowen to fight and even Brother Gilbert proves to be a master archer.Brok happens to ride by the village and finds the people fletching arrows and smithing whatever weapons of war they can; practicing combat and adapting farm tools to be used as weapons. He sees Draco in the village,hears him roar,and rushes off to inform Einon.Lord Felton smugly dismisses the revolt,but Einon warns him that he will not underestimate either Bowen or the dragon. Einon knows Bowen too well and takes the threat very seriously. Aislinn comes to Einon and presents him with a gift... a team of five of the finest dragonslayers in the land.When Bowen feels the villagers are ready,he leads the forces to Einon&apos;s castle. Einon is suited up in chain-mail armor and eager for battle. Felton and Brok try to stop him from rushing out,arguing that the castle is impregnable and the villagers will soon give up... but Draco begins assaulting the castle from the air,taking out many of its defenses,and easily outwitting the dragonslayers.Einon leads his men out to meet Bowen. Looking to crush Bowen,he signals a charge. Bowen signals a retreat and the villagers lead Einon&apos;s men into the woods,where suddenly the villagers turn to face the soldiers and more villagers come out of hiding,showing their numbers to be far greater than was thought. Numerous traps are set up through the village and Brother Gilbert hides in the trees with fellow archers,though hesitant to kill. He soon devises clever ways to distract and wound the soldiers. Bowen fights on horseback with his sword,while Kara leads the footsoldiers,battling with twin hand axes and slaying several soldiers in her own right.Seeing his soldiers losing the battle,Einon signals a retreat,turning and fleeing for the castle. Several villagers try to stop him but Einon dispatches them easily. Bowen yells for Brother Gilbert to stop Einon. Brother Gilbert struggles with the Commandment,&quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; before finally releasing an arrow right into Einon&apos;s heart. No sooner does the arrow strike that Draco drops from the sky like a stone with a harsh cry. Bowen freezes in his tracks,stricken with horror,watching Einon slowly pull the arrow out of his chest in bewilderment. Suddenly Einon spurs his horse and races to the castle,where the dragonslayers have chained Draco down with a web of steel chains. Einon reaches them and orders them not to kill Draco... he wants him alive,and safe...&quot;for all eternity&quot;. Draco moans,&quot;Oh... no.&quot;Bowen goes to the castle to save Draco with Kara and Brother Gilbert. Kara starts to lead them through the secret passage she was led through by Aislinn,and Hewe and the peasant soldiers meet up with them,saying they need to open a gate so the other villagers can enter. Bowen emerges with Kara and Brother Gilbert inside the castle in Einon&apos;s room,where they find Einon waiting for them. Bowen and Einon battle through the underground sewers and back to the castle.Hewe and the peasant soldiers kill several guards through the gate and open it. Felton is looking to escape and sees Kara approaching. Hiding,he grabs her from behind,looking to use her as a hostage to escape,but Hewe stabs him in the back and kills him.Running through the castle,Kara is ambushed by Brok but he is too overconfident that he leaves himself wide open for a killing strike from a two-handed battle axe Kara grabs. He dies in astonishment,saying &quot;a...girl&quot; over again.In the courtyard where Draco is being held and guarded,we see a silhouetted figure approach a soldier,who bows to the silhouette,before being stabbed dead with a knife. Draco recognizes Aislinn and calls her forth. Aislinn kneels before Draco,who knows that she is here for only one reason. Aislinn picks up a long spear and prepares to stab Draco with it,but Einon stops her. The hit he took from the arrow helped Einon figure out that his life is tied to Draco&apos;s and that as long as Draco lives,Einon is virtually immortal...but if Draco was killed,Einon would die as well. Aislinn explains that she made a mistake years ago when she &quot;saved a creature not worth saving&quot;. Einon,angry and disappointed at his mother&apos;s betrayal,merely says,&quot;How unmotherly of you.&quot; Draco strains against his chains,growling,as Aislinn turns away from Einon and walks off. Einon follows her into the shadows,carrying the spear,and we hear Aislinn cry out.Einon comes across Bowen and they battle their way up onto the parapets as Kara watches. Einon breaks Bowen&apos;s sword. As Bowen swings away from Einon on a pulley,Einon loses his balance and plunges off the parapet,breaking through a wooden walkway into the bottom of the castle. Bowen reaches Draco and starts to unchain him,and Draco reveals the final piece of the puzzle...through the shared heart,he and Einon share each other&apos;s physical pain,but Draco&apos;s half holds the life force,and he must die in order to vanquish Einon. Bowen has come to respect and admire Draco too much and cannot bring himself to kill his friend. But Einon appears,bloody but alive,grabbing Kara from behind and putting his sword to her neck. Draco bites hard on his own hand and Einon feels the pain and is forced to drop his sword. Kara pulls away from him,and Einon draws a dagger and rushes at Bowen. In a tense moment,Bown seems unsure until Draco gives him a reassuring smile,pulling back his chest plate. Bowen hurls Kara&apos;s axe into Draco&apos;s heart. Einon gasps and collapses in shock as Draco smiles at Bowen one last time before peacefully dying.Kara,Brother Gilbert,and the victorious villagers gather around the body of Draco where Bowen is mourning his passing,not knowing who or where to turn to for inspiration. Then he hears Draco&apos;s voice telling him to look to the stars. Draco&apos;s body dissipates into a rolling ball of reddish light that slowly ascends into the skies,heading toward the constellation that Bowen named him after. The other stars gather around Draco&apos;s soul-- the collective of dragons welcoming the last of their kind home. Bowen smiles as he sees that Draco has redeemed himself and gained entry into his heaven.The movie closes with a voiceover from Brother Gilbert,recounting that Bowen and Kara led the people of the kingdom through a golden age of wisdom,justice,and brotherhood for many years,and that Draco&apos;s star always shone down on them as a source of inspiration and strength,whenever they needed him.</Plot>

        <Plot>In 1942,Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law),a shepherd from the Ural Mountains who is now a soldier in the Red Army,finds himself on the front lines of the Battle of Stalingrad. Sent on a suicidal charge against the invading Germans,he uses impressive marksmanship skillstaught to him by his grandfather from a young ageto save himself and commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes). Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate the city&apos;s defenses and demands ideas to improve morale. Danilov,now a Senior Lieutenant,suggests that the people need figures to idolize,and publishes tales of Vassili&apos;s exploits in the army&apos;s newspaper that paint him as a national hero and propaganda icon. Vassili is transferred to the sniper division,and he and Danilov become friends. They also both become romantically interested in Tania (Rachel Weisz),a citizen of Stalingrad who has become a Private in the local militia. Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit away from the battlefield.With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces,German Major Erwin König (Ed Harris) is deployed to Stalingrad to take out Vassili and thus crush Soviet morale. A renowned marksman and head of the German Army sniper school at Zossen,he lures Vassili into a trap and takes out two of his fellow snipers,but Vassili manages to escape. When the Red Army command learns of König&apos;s mission,they dispatch his former student Koulikov (Ron Perlman) to help Vassili kill him. However,König tricks Koulikov into revealing his position and kills him with a very skillful shot,shaking Vassili&apos;s spirits considerably. Khrushchev pressures Danilov to bring the sniper standoff to a conclusion.When Tania requests to be reassigned to the sniper division,Danilov asks Vassili to discourage her. Vassili attempts to do so,but relents when Tania tells him how her Jewish parents were murdered by the Germans. Danilov recruits young local boy Sacha Fillipov (Gabriel Thomson),who idolizes Vassili and does small jobs for the Germans in exchange for food,to act as a double agent by passing König false information about Vassili&apos;s whereabouts,thus giving Vassili a chance to ambush the Major. Vassili sets a trap for König and manages to wound him,but during a second attempt Vassili falls asleep after many hours and his sniper log is taken by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vassili&apos;s death and plans to send König home,but the Major does not believe that Vassili is dead. He tells Sacha where he will be next,suspecting that the boy will tell Vassili. Tania and Vassili have meanwhile fallen in love,and the jealous Danilov disparages Vassili in a letter to his superiors.König spots Tania and Vassili waiting for him at his next ambush,confirming his suspicions about Sacha. He kills the boy and hangs his body from a pole to bait Vassili. Vassili vows to kill König and sends Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sacha&apos;s mother (Eva Mattes) from the city,but Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the evacuation boats. Thinking her dead,Danilov laments his jealousy for Vassili and his resulting disenchantment with the communist cause. Finding Vassili waiting to ambush König,Danilov intentionally exposes himself in order to reveal the Major&apos;s position and is killed. Thinking he has killed Vassili,König goes to inspect the body,but realizes too late that he has fallen into a trap and is in Vassili&apos;s sights. He turns to face Vassili,who then kills him. Two months later,after Stalingrad has been liberated and the German forces have surrendered,Vassili finds Tania recovering in a field hospital.</Plot>

        <Plot>The first 15 minutes of the film acts as an edited account of Evil Dead I. This alternate version starts with protagonist Ashley &apos;Ash&apos; J. Williams (Bruce Campbell),and girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler),driving to an abandoned cabin high in the mountains. Within the cabin Ash plays a tape which explains that the cabin belongs to a Prof. Raymond Knowby (John Peakes) who was busy translating passages from &quot;Necronomicon Ex Mortis&quot;,the book of the dead. As the tape translates one of the passages,it awakens an evil force that possesses Linda.Discovering Linda&apos;s disappearance,our Hero ventures outside and is attacked by the now-demonfied Linda. Panicking,the terrified Ash gets lucky and manages to decapitate the love of his life with a handy shovel. Following this murder,Mr Williams decides to do the decent thing and buries his,now headless,girlfriend.It&apos;s at this point the summary of the first film ends as the evil force sweeps in and carries the stressed Ash through the woods,possessing him. Fortunately the sun comes up and drives away the kandarian demon,leaving Ash perfectly healthy,if not a little depressed.At this point Ash bravely clambers into his Oldsmobile and makes a dash for freedom only to find that the bridge is now destroyed,presumably by evil forces. Yet again the evil pursues him to the cabin and then through it,but Ash,using all his cunning,evades it.Following a manly nap,our lovable coward wakes in an armchair to piano music. Looking outside he sees Linda&apos;s corpse re-animate (Ted Raimi!!!) and dance. She then vanishes and her head appears in Ash&apos;s lap,biting hard on his right hand. Unable to remove the head he rushes to the workshed and puts it in a vice,causing it to release its grip and,instead starts to mock Mr Williams,who has already had a trying day. To make matters worse the headless torso charges into the shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw. Yet again blind luck saves Ash and he defeats the body and uses the chainsaw to destroy Linda&apos;s head,this time she&apos;s obviously got on Ash&apos;s bad side as she gets no further burial.Upon returning to the cabin with a shotgun,Ash is further frightened by an unseen entity moaning on the rocking chair. Dropping the shotgun,he tries to console himself by telling his reflection in the mirror that everything is fine. However,his reflection suddenly comes to life and contradicts him,laughing at Ash&apos;s predicament and then throttling Ash before vanishing.Continuing this luckless night Ash&apos;s hand has seemingly became possessed and starts attacking Ash with plates,knocking him unconscious. It then spots a cleaver and starts to drag Ash&apos;s unconscious body towards it. But Ash wakes up stabs his own hand and hacks it off with the very chainsaw he used only moments ago to hack his lover to pieces.He traps his amputated hand in a tin,but it escapes and hides inside the wall. Ash fires several shells into the wall in an attempt to kill it,and the walls begin to bleed,spraying Ash and covering the entire room in blood. Suddenly the blood vanishes back into the walls,and Ash falls backwards into a chair that breaks under his weight. A deer head mounted on the wall suddenly begins to laugh at Ash,and other items in the house,such as lamps,cabinets,and books,join in. Ash,who appears to be losing his sanity,laughs along with them. The laughter ends abruptly when Ash hears movement outside the front door.The people at the door are Annie Knowby -Prof Knowby&apos;s daughter- (Sarah Berry) who has pages of the Necronomicon with her,boyfriend Ed Gentley (Richard Domeier)-who&apos;s not really important as he&apos;ll be hacked to pieces within 15 minutes- and their two red neck guides,Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobbie Jo (Kassie Wesley DePaiva). Ash shoots through the door,clearly on his last nerve. This result in grazing Bobby Jo. Ed and Jake restrain Ash as Annie notices the absence of her parents in the cabin. After seeing the blood on the chainsaw and on Ash,they come to the conclusion that he killed Annie&apos;s parents. The four newcomers throw Ash into the fruit cellar.Annie,Ed,Jake,and Bobby Jo listen to recordings of Professor Knowby&apos;s,where they learn that Knowby killed Henrietta (Lou Hancock) -Annie&apos;s mother- after she became possessed,and buried her body in the fruit cellar. Surprisingly Henrietta then rises from the grave and attacks the luckless Ash. The other four take pity on him and release him from his basement prison and force the demon wife into the cellar,although this procedure results in Bobby Jo getting a mouthful of eye ball. Fortunately Henrietta is locked underground.But that&apos;s not this demon done yet,it takes human form and tries to persuade Annie to let it out (That&apos;s right,she&apos;s a crafty kandarian demon). Ash sees through this trick,grabs Annie and shakes his head. This sheer act of manliness overwhelms Annie and makes her say &quot;That thing in the cellar is not my mother&quot;. At this point it becomes apparent that Ed too has rudely became possessed and,even more rudely takes a bite out of Bobby Jo&apos;s hair and tells them all that they will be &quot;Dead by Dawn&quot;. Ash appears to flee at this point and receives a shouting from Annie.But low and behold our Hero has not fled and as the others have been frozen with fear Ash returns brandishing an Axe. He hacks Ed to pieces (told you) and casually explains their predicament to the others.Following some unconvincing sound affects,the spirit of the professor appears before Ash and the others,telling them that the pages Annie possesses are the key to dispelling the evil dead. Bobby Jo then discovers Ash&apos;s possessed hand holding hers,and she runs into the forest,where she is attacked and killed by the trees. Annie and Ash find a drawing in the book depicting a hero said to have dispelled the evil; the hero appears as a figure with a chainsaw-like hand and a &quot;boomstick.&quot; Hysterical with fear for Bobby Jo,Jake picks up the shotgun and forces everyone to go after her. Ash tries to convince Jake that Bobby Jo is dead,but Jake grows furious and throws the book pages into the cellar. The group goes into the woods,only to discover that the trail has disappeared. A demon rushes them,again possessing Ash,and throws Jake into a tree. Ash chases Annie back to the cabin. She grabs the bone dagger from the first movie and accidentally stabs Jake as he is trying to get back into the cabin.She pulls Jake&apos;s body inside and shuts the door. Ash pounds on the door,then suddenly stops. Annie removes the dagger from Jake and then drags him to the cellar door,where Henrietta attacks and kills him. Ash attacks Annie,accidentally ripping her necklace off her neck. As she lays unconscious,Ash looks at the necklace and reverts to his normal self after being reminded of Linda. After convincing a terrified Annie that he is no longer possessed,Ash and Annie agree to vanquish the evil together.This calls for an awesome montage,as Ash uses his technical know-how to convert the chainsaw into a chainsaw hand,fitting firmly on his amputated stump and sawing the end of his shotgun. The scene ends up with a close up of his rugged face and he announces &quot;Groovy&quot;. This establishes that the previous coward has become a lean mean deadite slaying machine.Ash and Annie return to the cabin,where Ash enters the cellar and finds the pages strewn about the floor,seemingly leading him deeper into the darkness. Henrietta leaps out of the cellar door and attacks Annie. Ash emerges from the cellar and begins fighting with Henrietta; he has the upper hand until Henrietta transforms into a more vicious demonic form. Ash is saved when Annie distracts Henrietta by singing a lullaby that Henrietta sang to her when she was a girl. While Henrietta is focused on Annie,Ash uses his chainsaw to decapitate the demon,then deals the final blow by delivering a shotgun blast to its head. Annie takes the pages and begins translating the text to manifest the evil,which appears in the form of a large bloody head covered in the faces of those it has possessed. While Ash fends off the creature,Annie recites the incantation to rid the earth of the evil. A large vortex opens up just outside the cabin,gravitating everything around into it,including Ash&apos;s car,a large tree,and the evil itself. Annie is then stabbed in the back by Ash&apos;s severed hand. With her dying breaths,she speaks the last words of the incantation,and Ash is sucked into the vortex before it disappears.Ash suddenly falls from the sky and lands on a large block of rock. He looks up and finds himself surrounded by medieval knights. The knights are about to attack Ash when a winged demonic creature swoops down from the sky,terrifying the knights as they scatter. Ash reaches for his shotgun and blows the creature&apos;s head off. The knights gather around Ash as he prepares to defend himself. One knight then lifts his face plate and declares,&quot;Hail he who hath fallen from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites!&quot; The army of medieval warriors then falls to their knees and begins chanting &quot;hail&quot; as Ash realizes that he is in fact the prophesied &quot;Hero from the Sky.&quot; The film closes with Ash shaking his head in disbelief and screaming &quot;No!&quot; as the camera pans out to show the large army that now awaits Ash&apos;s command.</Plot>

        <Plot>Region-Free British Release, playable on all US blu-ray players. Groundbreaking on several counts, not the least of which was an innovative use of animation and stereophonic sound, this ambitious Disney feature has lost nothing to time since its release in 1940. Classical music was interpreted by Disney animators, resulting in surreal fantasy and playful escapism. Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra provided the music for eight segments by the composers Tchaikovsky, Moussorgsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Ponchielli, Bach, Dukas, and Schubert. Not all the sequences were created equally, but a few are simply glorious, such as &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice&quot;, and &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;. The animation ranges from subtly delicate to fiercely bold. The screen bursts with color and action as creatures transmute and convention is thrust aside. The painstaking detail and saturated hues are unique to this film, unmatched even by more advanced technology. --Rochelle O&apos;Gorman</Plot>

        <Plot>Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie â&quot; a.k.a. Flight of the Conchords â&quot; may be âNew Zealandâs 4th Most Popular Folk Parody Duo,â but in the USA, finding someone who knows their act is about as easy as finding a kiwi nest in Central Park. To rectify this oversight, Jemaine and Bret have moved to New Yorkâs East Village to conquer America, one fan (literally) at a time.</Plot>

        <Plot>World War I began in Europe in 1914,but by 1917,the United States had still not entered the war. However,many brave young American men went to France to fly and fight for the Allied powers. They joined the Lafayette Escadrille fighter squadron. The Germans had better planes,weapons,and pilots. The average life expectancy for a fighter-pilot was three to six weeks. Why did these Americans volunteer to fight in France with certain death when their own country was not at war? This was a time when men were idealistic,but naive to embark on a great adventure. Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) was forced to leave his home in Texas after the family ranch was foreclosed by the bank. Blaine sees a newsreel of fighter-pilots in France and decides that he has nothing to lose. Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) can&apos;t do anything right and is shamed into joining by his rich father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) had been living in France,a racially tolerant country,for many years,wanted to give something back to his new country. These Americans were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno) and American Squadron Leader Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson). Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens with Priest Vallon (Liam Nesson) shaving,he cuts his cheek and then hands the blade to his son Amsterdam,who is about to wipe the blood. Vallon tells him to leave it there,and his son puts away the blade in a black cloth with a sliver cross clasp (important later). He then says a prayer to St. Michael,puts a medallion over Amsterdam&apos;s head,grabs a steel cross,and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing their weapons,including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon,his son,and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he&apos;ll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars,so Monk agrees picks up his wooden club,and kicks open the door,revealing the snow-filled Five Points section of New York City.Vallon and his crew,aka the Dead Rabbits,leave the brewery and make their way onto the street. Amsterdam runs to join children on the steps of a nearby building,while the Dead Rabbits await the arrival of the Native. A few moments later,men dressed in blue,led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis),a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye,walk onto the street,clearly outnumbering the Rabbits. Bill tells Vallon that New York has been ruined by the Irish who will work for less pay than the slaves and should return home. Vallon recants that it&apos;s a free country,and is then joined by more men.Moments later,they begin fighting. Monk is mashing people in the head,Maggie is biting a man&apos;s ear off,and people&apos;s legs are getting broken while others are being stabbed. Bill and Vallon slowly make their way towards each other,but as Vallon draws near Bill directs one of his men to attack Vallon. Vallon kills the man,but is stabbed by Bill in the process. Vallon tries to fight back,but is stabbed in the rib. Vallon falls to the ground,and a horn is blown. All of the men stop fighting and stand around the dying Vallon. Amsterdam pushes his way to his father&apos;s side. Bill makes a speech about how all the fighting is done and how he has slain Vallon. Vallon looks at his son,tells him to always stay focused and then asks Bill to finish him,which Bill obliges,leaving the knife on Vallon&apos;s chest. Bill says that Vallon may not be touched so that he may reach Heaven with honor. Monk tells him to wait,goes over to Vallon&apos;s body and takes something from his pocket,and then offers Amsterdam his condolences. As they haul Vallon away,Bill&apos;s men ask what they should do with the boy. He tells them to put him in a school so he could get an education. Amsterdam quickly grabs the knife from his father&apos;s chest,threatens Bill&apos;s men,and runs inside the brewery. As the men chase him,a boy hits one of them in the shin,causing him to fall. Amsterdam runs down to his cave,opens a secret compartment in the ground,and places the medallion and dagger inside. Bill&apos;s men grab him. As we zoom out of the area,we see that the battle took place in Lower Manhattan and the year is 1846.Sixteen years pass and Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) is being given a blessing and a Bible by a priest. He is still in New York but in an orphanage on a nearby island. As he leaves,he looks at an Asian man,walks over a bridge,and tosses the Bible in the ocean.Bill the Butcher is walking through a hallway of Tammany Hall to the office of Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent),who is running for some sort of political office. Tweed is discussing how they can get more voters and other things. Then it cuts to Amsterdam walking on the docks as more Irish are disembarking a ship. Particularly an old woman who is hit in the face by something one of Bill&apos;s men threw and is yelling for her to get back on the boat. She falls to the floor,and is helped up by a gentleman and some children.Amsterdam passes them by and is greeted by a man who welcomes him,offers him bread,and reminds him to vote for Tweed. Amsterdam is also asked to draft in the army,but refuses. Other Irish are offered money,three meals a day,and luxuries for their families if they join right away and ship out immediately. They agree,register,change,and board a boat.Amsterdam makes his way to his cave and opens the compartment. He takes out the dagger and the medallion. He is interrupted by Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas) and Jimmy Spoils (Larry Gilliard Jr.) as he says a prayer. They tell him to give them his possessions,and when he refuses,Jimmy tries to attack him,but Amsterdam knocks him over and almost breaks his nose. Johnny pulls out a knife,which Amsterdam turns against him. Johnny notices the medallion. Amsterdam leaves the cave and goes out to the street. Johnny follows him and asks if he&apos;s the priest&apos;s son. Amsterdam answers yes,and Johnny begins to update him on the Five Points. He tells him how Maggie tried to open a pub,but drank herself out of business; how Monk owns a barber shop; and how Bill celebrates Priest Vallon&apos;s death every year.Johnny is then bumped into by Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz). He introduces her to Amsterdam. When she comments to them that they are terrible at conversation,Amsterdam recants that they are deep thinkers. She wishes them a good day and hopes the God shines on them and joins her friends. Johnny swears that Jenny likes him,but Amsterdam informs him that she stole his watch. Johnny searches his pockets,looks up,and tries to make it seem like it happens often.Later that night,a house is on fire. The sirens of Tweeds firemen can be heard closing in. A man covers a fire hydrant with a barrel and sits on it. Tweeds men come and he begins campaigning. Then another group of firemen come and the two groups start to fight. Johnny takes advantage,grabs Amsterdam,and enters the burning building in search of valuables. Amsterdam finds watches,while Johnny becomes mesmerized by a music box. A beam falls and traps him in. He calls for Amsterdam,who grabs more jewelry and heads out. He returns,jumps over the beam with a blanket,grabs Johnny,and helps him out of the house. Just as they are leaving,Bills men come,the barrel is removed from the hydrant,and they begin to put out the fire.Johnny then takes Amsterdam to meet his friends Fuzzy,Jimmy,and some others. There they show everything they stole from the burning building until Happy Jack (John C. Reilly) arrives. He was one of the Dead Rabbits who&apos;s now a crooked police officer. He takes a few pieces and leaves.The next day,Amsterdam and Johnny then take the rest to a pub/ brothel,where Bill plays cards. Johnny walks up to Bill and give him the money,but Amsterdam stays further back. He notices a drawing of his father on the wall. Bill asks Amsterdam what his name is. Amsterdam replies. Bill then calls himself New York,and tells Johnny how they can make more money.Later that night,Fuzzy,Jimmy,Amsterdam,and Johnny are rowing through the harbor until they reach a ship. When they board it,they find that it has already been robbed. They continue to search for anything that might have been left until Amsterdam notices a man dressed in a Union uniform coming out with a rifle. He warns Jimmy and everyone else to hit the deck. A shot is fired,but only into the air because the man was dying. The man falls forward to reveal a knife in his back. Everyone is in the rowboat waiting when a body falls inside it. Its the Union soldier. Amsterdam threw it in and he then jumps into the boat. He is then shown trading the body for money. The headline in the newspaper reads something about a gang who sells body to science. Bill applauds Amsterdams quick thinking,but his right hand man,Mr. McGloin doesn&apos;t agree. They begin calling each other names and eventually begin fighting. Amsterdam is clearly winning when the fight is broken up. During the scuffle,the drawing of Priest Vallon fell to the ground. Bill picks it up,looks at it,and puts it back on the wall. He then takes Amsterdam and Johnny on a tour of the Five Points as Happy Jack is giving a rich family a tour. Monk also walks by greets Bill,and pushes up Amsterdam&apos;s hat to get a look at Amsterdam&apos;s face.Amsterdam comes across Jenny again when she bumps into him. He immediately begins checking his pockets,but realizes too late that she took his medallion. He follows her onto a bus-type thing. He sees her brilliantly steal a mans pocket watch,and then follows her to the home of a wealthy family where she poses as a maid and steals some things. When shes done,he pulls her to the side and asks for his medallion. She threatens him with a knife and cuts him on his neck slightly before he takes it from her. She then opens her blouse and shows him all the medallions shes got. He takes his gives her back the dagger,and begins walking with her.Later,Im not sure when,he goes with Johnny to a dance. Jenny is seated with her back to the men and is holding a mirror. She passes up three men,including Johnny,before choosing Amsterdam.They begin dancing,and later go to the docks where they are about to have sex. She mentions Bill and he wonders what she gives him in return. When he realizes,he gets up and leaves.Amsterdam then begins working for Bill. He is even shown by Bill how to hurt or kill people by stabbing them in certain areas. Bill also makes Amsterdam,Fuzzy,Jimmy,and Johnny boxing bet collectors. When a boxing match is broken up by the police,Amsterdam finds a place where the police cannot break it up. Bill gives him all the glory,but his joy is interrupted when he sees Jenny leave with Johnny.Later at a showing of Uncle Toms Cabin,the audience begins throwing vegetables at the stage. An assassin uses this to try to kill Bill. Amsterdam notices,warns Bill,and tackles the guy to the ground,but not before he gets a shot off. He shoots Bill in the shoulder. Bills men shoot him in return. Bill then asks the guy who sent him,but the man dies before he can answer. Amsterdam then runs off and begins crying. Monk finds him,and tells him that his father tried helping the Irish,not the Natives. Amsterdam reminds Monk of taking money from Priest Vallon when he died. Monk then hands him the black cloth with the cross clasp,and says he took it for safe-keeping.Later that night,Bill,Amsterdam,Tweed,and others are drinking in the brothel. Jenny comes by and cleans Bills wound then goes upstairs to her room. Amsterdam angrily follows her and grabs her. She tells him shell bite him if he tries to kiss her. She lunges a few times,and they eventually kiss and sleep together. Johnny witnesses this and runs off.Amsterdam awakes to find Bill watching him. He asks Bill if it was okay that he slept with Jenny. Bill says he doesn&apos;t mind. Bill then begins talking about how Priest Vallon spared his life,and how Bill removed his own eye and sent it to Vallon. He then describes the day he killed Vallon. Bill then leaves.Amsterdam tells Jenny if she wants to know anything about him,she should ask. She explains how Bill took her in and how he never put his hands on her until she told him to. Later that night,Monk sees Amsterdam throwing a dagger into a block of wood. It&apos;s as if Amsterdam were practicing for something.Johnny is then seen talking to Bill. He tells Bill about Amsterdam being Vallon&apos;s son. Bill reacts violently,nearly killing Johnny,but he listens. Meanwhile,Amsterdam is seen walking into an Asian-themed restaurant. He tries to call Johnny as he walks to his table,but Johnny pays no mind. He sits,and Jenny comes to him. An announcer then comes and begs Bill to perform with his daggers. He asks for his apprentice,Jenny. She steps onto the stage and Bill begins throwing knives,all nearly missing her. It gets to a point where he is seriously scaring her,and even cuts her neck. He then walks to his table,says some words about Vallon,and lifts up his drink of fire. Amsterdam then throws a dagger at Bill,who hits it.His men grab Amsterdam,and Bill then wounds him by stabbing him. He then has Amsterdam put on a table,nearly stabs him a couple of times,then hits Amsterdam several times in the face with his head.Jenny then takes Amsterdam away to a cave where she nurses him back to health. When he feels better,he hangs a dead rabbit in the middle of the Five Points. Bill sends Happy Jack to kill Amsterdam,but Amsterdam kills Jack instead. Amsterdam and his men now dressed in red are gathering strength,even to the point where Tweed asks for their help in getting votes. He makes a deal with them to allow them to have an Irish sheriff and he will get all Irish votes. They choose Monk,who wins. This upsets Bill,who challenges Monk outside his barber shop. When Monk suggests they go inside and turns his back,Bill throws a butcher knife into Monks back. He then takes Monks club (which has 44 carvings in it to mark how many people Monk has killed),carves a new notch into it,and jabs it into the butcher knife,killing Monk. This pushes Amsterdam over the edge,and he agrees to a challenge with Bill. In a neutral area,they discuss the terms and the day.The day arrives and Amsterdam cuts himself on the cheek as his father had done. He looks at Jenny,who tells him that shes leaving for San Francisco today with or without him. He tells her it will be over tomorrow,but she leaves.Across town,the draft officers are going around telling citizens that unless they pay $300 they have to join the army. A riot breaks out,and crowds start pillaging the streets. They even break into the house of the rich family that previously visited the Five Points. Jenny and Jimmy are even attacked in the process. The violence gets so bad that they call the army in,and ships begin firing cannons at the city just as the Dead Rabbits and the Natives begin their showdown. --The cannons break up the two groups,leaving only Amsterdam and Bill to fight.

        <Plot>The movie opens with the voice of the Caretaker (Sam Elliot) relating the legend of the Ghost Rider - a damned soul condemned to walk the earth and obey the Devil&apos;s orders. A Ghost Rider had been sent to collect a parchment known as the Contract of San Venganza,which holds the power of 1000 evil souls. The Ghost Rider knew that this Contract was pure evil,so he betrayed his heritage and outran the Devil himself.Scene shifts to a carnival,where the father-sun stunt duo of Barton &amp; Johnny Blaze are performing on ramps for the crowd. After the show,Barton chastises Johnny for showing off and being extra reckless because his girlfriend Roxanne was in the crowd.Later that day,Roxanne and Johnny meet and Roxanne tells Johnny that her father is sending her away. Johnny decides to pack up and they will run away together.Johnny goes back to find his father asleep,holding a piece of paper. It is a report from a doctor,and the news is not good- Barton Blaze has cancer and it appears to be terminal. Crushed,Johnny goes out to work on his motorcycle.A strange man in black (Peter Fonda) approaches Johnny and asks if Johnny will perhaps one day ride for him. The man mentions Barton&apos;s illness,and offers to help. Johnny asks what he could give in return,and the man says &quot;Your soul.&quot; Johnny,thinking the man crazy or sarcastic,responds &quot;OK.&quot; The man in black offers Johnny a contract,and Johnny cuts himself when opening it. The man in black accepts this blood drop as an appropriate signature.Johnny wakes up in bed with Barton energetic and cheerful. Barton confesses to Johnny that he had been sick,but now feels &quot;heathly as a horse.&quot; Johnny is stunned. Barton attempts a new stunt at the show (jumping through a ring of fire),but he comes up short and crashes. Johnny tearfully watches his father die while the man in black laughs ominously.Johnny sees Roxanne at the hilltop,but does not join her and rides off into the distance. The man in black approaches Johnny,promising that one day he will come for Johnny&apos;s services when needed.Fast-forward about 10 years and the adult Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) is attempting a new stunt at a sold-out stadium. Johnny clears the targets on the field,but comes up short on the landing,wrecking his bike and sending him crashing into a wall. Johnny&apos;s pit crew,led by his best friend Mack (Donal Logue) rush to his side and find Johnny dazed but uninjured. The crowd roars with cheers as Johnny gets back up.Later,Johnny and his crew are on the road. Mack is perplexed,believing that there is no way Johnny should have survived that crash. Mack suggests taht maybe Johnny has a guardian angel,and Johnny mildly suggests that &quot;Maybe it&apos;s something else.&quot; Mack and the crew watch a TV advertisement for Johnny&apos;s next stunt,taking place in his old hometown. Johnny will be attempting to clear an entire football field (300 Feet),jumping over 50 cars in the process.Meanwhile,another strange figure in black (Wes Bentley) arrives at a Hell&apos;s Angels club out in the desert. He proceeds to kill nearly all of the members with a single touch.Mack and Johnny arrive at Johnny&apos;s apartment,where Mack tries to talk Johnny out of doing this new stunt because it seems too risky. Mack is worried because Johnny is becoming increasingly reckless while delving into strange interests (Johnny&apos;s apartment has a lot of strange books about the occult). onn responds that he is merely looking for &quot;a sign and a second chance.&quot;Back at the Hell&apos;s Angels bar,this figure in black is introduced as Blackheart. He is approached by 3 elemental spirits; Gressil (earth),Wallow (water) and Abigor (wind) and recruits their help in finding the Contract of San Venganza. The spirits agree even though they are afraid of another spirit named Mephistopheles (a name that angers Blackheart).Johnny is getting ready for his new stunt when he is approached by a reporter for an interview. To his shock,it is his old girlfriend Roxanne (Eva Mendes). Johnny is so stunned by her arrival that he cannot answer any of her interview questions. Roxanne breaks off the interview and leaves before Johnny begins his jump.Mack joins Johnny on the ramp,feeling relieved now that Johnny has agreed to take the cars out of the jump. Johnny then reveals that he thought of something else to put in,and the stadium roof opens to allow 6 BlackHawk helicopters enter. Mack is angry about this change and demands to know what prompted such an idea. Johnny explains that his father Barton thought it would be cool.Johnny sets up his bike,mind obviously still focused on Roxanne. Without warning,he throttles up and heads down the ramp! After a few tense seconds,Johnny makes it across with a perfect landing. Johnny waves to the crowd and then speeds off.Roxanne and her news van are riding down the expressway when they are confronted by Johnny. Johnny pulls a few stunts to get the van to stop so he can talk to Roxanne. Roxanne relents,telling Johnny to meet her in the restaurant of her hotel later that evening. A group of motorists angry at the stop of traffic storm over to see what is happening,but when they find out that Johnny Blaze is on the freeway they swarm around asking for autographs.Blackheart and his gang confront Mephistopheles,the man in black who made the contract with Johnny. Mephistopheles warns them about trying to take the contract of San Venganza,and threatens them with the Ghost Rider. Blackheart is unafraid. It is revealed through this conversation that Blackheart is Mephistopheles&apos; son.Johnny is preparing for his date with Roxanne when he notices his hands glowing bright red. He washes them only to observe steam rising off his palms. Johnny goes out into the alley to find a brand-new motorcycle revved up and waiting for him. Mephistopheles appears,revealing that he has decided to invoke Johnny&apos;s services. Mephistopheles explains that he has been keeping Johnny alive all this time so that this day could come. Mephistopheles compels Johnny to get on the new bike and sends him off after Blackheart,offering to return Johnny&apos;s soul if he is successful.Johnny&apos;s new bike sets off at such a speed that it burns a trail of fire and destruction through the town.Blackheart and his gang arrive at a train yard where they are confronted by the night watchman. Blackheart is curious,stating that this land was once a cemetery. The watchman explains that the graves were moved by St. Michael&apos;s Church,and Blackheart kills him.Johnny arrives and dismounts the bike,thrashing in pain. Fire erupts from his feet and hands,as Johnny roars with a mixture of pain and evil desire. Finally his head bursts into flame,revealing a skeletal skull. Johnny Blaze has become the new Ghost Rider.Blackheart confronts the Ghost Rider and sends in his elementals to fight. Ghost Rider grabs some chains off a nearby wall to use as weapons but ist stopped when Gressil drives a truck into the building. Ghost Rider erupts from behind the truck,lighting one of his chains on fire and ensnaring Gressil. Gressil screams in pain as he is turned to stone and dissolves.Ghost Rider whistles and his motorcycle appears. He touches the gas cap and the motorcycle transforms into a firey skull-and-chain entity,much like the Ghost Rider himself. He rides through town and spots a young woman being mugged. He grabs the mugger (who stabs him,but the knife merely melts off in Ghost Rider&apos;s body). Ghost Rider commands the mugger to &quot;Look into my eyes.&quot; The mugger screams in horror as his memories of past crimes come back to haunt him. When this torture is finished,Ghost Rider tosses the mugger aside.Ghost Rider ends his drive through town on the outskirts,obviously growing weaker by the oncoming morning. He arrives in a cemetary and slowly but painfully changes back into Johnny Blaze. Johnny collapses at the headstone of his father,Barton.Roxanne,angry at Johnny for standing her up,reports on the chaos in town. The police find a license plate during the investigation that belongs to one of Johnny Blaze&apos;s bikes.Johnny is found by the Caretaker,who offers help. Johnny is skeptical at first,but relents. The Caretaker explains that the Ghost Rider is essentially &quot;the Devil&apos;s bounty hunter,&quot; who must hunt down anyone escaping from hell. Furthermore,the Ghost Rider only appears at night or in the presence of evil. Johnny remembers what he did to the mugger,and the caretaker explains that that was the Ghost Rider&apos;s greatest weapon - the Penance Stare. It makes anyone who feels it experience the pain of every sin they have caused.The Caretaker explains the story of the last Ghost Rider,and the town of San Venganza&apos;s souls. He also reveals that the spirits following Blackheart are The Hidden- fallen angels cast out of Heaven. Johnny leaves to take care of some business,which the Caretaker advises against (Blackheart and The Hidden cannot come onto sacred ground such as the cemetery,so Johnny would be safer staying there).Johnny looks at the devastation caused by last night&apos;s events. He meets Roxanne,who is very mad at him. Johnny goes back to his apartment and does some research about &quot;fire elements,&quot; and is able to display a minor degree of control over his new powers. Roxanne arrives and asks him what has been going on with Johnny. Johnny decides to be honest with her,but Roxanne does not accept his story (selling the soul to the devil and becoming a bounty hunter),thinking he is either lying to keep her away or has gone insane.Johnny walks outside and the police bring him in,thinking him responsible for the murders last night. Johnny denies any involvement,and the police throw him in a holding cell. The inmates recognize Johnny,and decide to attack him out of revenge for never seeing him fail in his stunt shows. One young inmate stands up for Johnny but he is knocked aside. The remaining inmates jump on Johnny,who effortlessly transforms into Ghost Rider and defeats them all.Ghost Rider steals the lead thug&apos;s jacket and gloves,making small spikes emerge from the metal detailing. Ghost Rider proceeds to burn through the cell bars and leaves. He hesitates for a minute in confronting the young inmate who stood up for him,then proclaims the young man to be &quot;Innocent&quot; and walks off.Blackheart is seen at St. Michael&apos;s Church,asking the minister about the Contract of San Venganza. The minister denies any knowledge,so Blackheart kills him. Upon learning that Ghost Rider is active again,Blackheart sends Abigor to deal with him.Ghost Rider reclaims his motorcycle and escapes from police custody. The cops quickly give pursuit,eventually trapping him in a dead-end alley. Ghost Rider merely tilts his motorcycle and proceeds to ride straight up the building! Roxanne,in a building across the block,is packing to leave when she looks out and sees the strange display.Ghost Rider confronts Abigor on the rooftop,but they are ambushed by a police helicopter. Ghost Rider uses his chains to throw the copter away from the roof so they do not interfere. Ghost Rider then attempts to catch Abigor just like he did with Gressil,but Abigor uses his wind powers to escape. This gives Ghost Rider an idea: he ignites a chain and spins it,causing a cyclone that pulls in Abigor. After a few minutes of resistance,the Wind Spirit is destroyed.The police attempt to apprehend Ghost Rider as he comes down from the roof. Ghost Rider attempts to resist,until he spots Roxanne in the crowd. The flames on Ghost Rider&apos;s head grow fainter as he approaches Roxanne. The police see this as an advantage and open fire with their weapons. Ghost Rider conjures a wall of flame and escapes,retreating to the cemetery.The Caretaker finishes the story of the Contract of San Venganza by telling Johnny about the previous Ghost Rider - a former Texas Ranger named Carter Slade. Slade became corrupt and made a deal with Mephistopheles to save his life. When Carter Slade saw what was happening at San Venganza,he took the Contract and hid it. The Caretaker puts forth the theory that Carter was buried with it.Roxanne returns to Johnny&apos;s apartment where she meets Mack. Mack talks bout how Johnny has had weird interests recently and Roxanne begins to fip through some of Johnny&apos;s books. She is now convinced that what Johnny told her was true. Blackheart suddenly appears and kills Mack.Johnny returns to find Mack dead and Blackheart holding Roxanne captive. He transforms into Ghost Rider and attempts to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart. He merely laughs,explaining that the Penance Stare will not work on him because he has no soul. Blackheat agrees to free Roxanne if Johnny brings him the Contract at the ruins of San Venganza by morning.Johnny returns to the cemetery,vowing to dig up the entire place if need be. The Caretaker shatters his shovel,revealing a rolled-up parchment in the handle. It is the contract. Johnny decides to take it and have a final fight with Blackheart. The Caretaker relents,thinking that Johnny&apos;s circumstances make him unpredictable and he just might have an advantage.The Caretaker whistles,summoning a mysterious horse from the shadows. He climbs on and bursts into flames. The Caretaker reveals that HE is Carter Slade,the previous Ghost Rider. Both Riders head out to San Venganza.Carter escorts Johnny to San Venganza,but then collapses. Carter explains that the trip has exhausted the last of his Ghost Rider powers. Carter gives Johnny a shotgun and then rides off into the sunset,ready to face eternity for his actions.Johnny is riding into San Venganza when he is ambushed by Wallow,the last surviving Hidden. Wallow pulls Johnny underwater,trying to drown him. Johnny counters by transforming into Ghost Rider and superheating the water,evaporating Wallow.Blackheart appears with Roxanne in custody. He lets Roxanne go as Johnny hands over the contract. Before Blackheart can take the Contract,Johnny transforms into Ghost Rider and attacks. Blackheart manages to fight off Ghost Rider&apos;s attacks and reads the Contract,commanding the spirits within the town to join with him. The spirits emerge and unite with Blackheart,who then proclaims &quot;My name is Legion; for we are many.&quot;Roxanne attacks Legion with Carter Slade&apos;s shotgun. It wounds him but does little to slow his advance. Johnny catches the shotgun and infuses it with his Ghost Rider powers,turning it into a hell-fire weapon. The blast disintegrates Legion,but he effortlessly begins to reform.Johnny realizes that Legion now has all thousand souls from San Venganza trapped within him,and has made himself vulnerable to Ghost Rider&apos;s greatest weapon. He transforms into Ghost Rider one last time and traps Legion long enough to use the Penance Stare. Legion screams in agony as the sins of one thousand souls pass through his body. Legion reverts to Blackheart and dies,the Penance Stare having succeeded once again.Mephistopheles arrives and congratulates Johnny on his success. He offers to take back the Ghost Rider powers,but Johnny refuses. He decides to keep the powers and use them against Mephistopheles&apos; evil. He is angry but he cannot take back the power by force,and vows to make Johnny pay.Johnny and Roxanne share an emotional farewell as Johnny vows to head out and go wherever the road takes him.</Plot>

        <Plot>Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hit Good Will Hunting triumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho, Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that&apos;s relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women&apos;s melodrama in the &apos;30s and &apos;40s: He&apos;s crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom. Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgård). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor&apos;s former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film&apos;s beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck&apos;s clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another. --Dave McCoy</Plot>

        <Plot>Two police officers are called to report to a domestic disturbance,with the possibility of a severe case of animal abuse. Neighbors are reporting noises which sound like an animal being cruelly abused. The police barge into the apartment and find Tucker Max (Matt Czuchry) having rough sex with a girl doggy style. The girl is screaming like an animal. The officers,assuming that Tucker is raping her,throw him onto the floor. The girl,who was just denied her orgasm,yells at the cops who shake their heads in disgust when they realize that she was making the noise because she was deaf and cannot hear her own voice.The next day,Tucker arrives at his college and meets his friend Dan (Geoff Stills) in their law class. Dan is getting married next weekend and Tucker will be throwing Dan&apos;s bachelor party along with their friend Drew. He tells Dan about how the cops burst in and interrupted the sex,while Dan notes that since Tucker screwed a mute girl last semester,he is one disabled person away from a &apos;Helen Keller&apos;. Tucker laughs at that and his law professor calls him out on the fact that he isn&apos;t paying attention. Tucker boldly states to his professor (and the class) that he wasn&apos;t since he was telling his friend about how he slept with a deaf girl. The professor thinks he&apos;s joking and then begins to grill him about whether or not people suffering from dwarfism should be protected by law. Tucker easily counters the professor&apos;s argument by pointing out that midgets already have protected status. The professor then mentions a midget stripper he represent pro bono to illustrate a further point,but once Tucker hears about the midget stripper he begins making arrangements. Tucker immediately leaves to go to Drew.Meanwhile,Drew (Jesse Bradford) is in his room playing the video game &apos;Halo&apos; online in his special chair when Tucker calls him. Drew continues to play,barely reacting to the fact that Tucker is coming over. Tucker arrives at Drew&apos;s door and sees a box with his ex-fiancÃÂ©&apos;s belongings with the label &quot;Take what you wish since her box is open to all.&quot; Drew was recently dumped by his slut of a fiancÃÂ©e,whom he walked in on &quot;giving a blow job to Paul Wall,the Grillionaire&quot;. As such,Drew has become embittered and spiteful toward women. Tucker tells Drew to come out with Dan for his bachelor party,and Drew reluctantly agrees.At a local bar,the &apos;Loathsome Lothario&apos; Tucker hits on an attractive waitress and she flirts with him back. When Dan arrives,Tucker smacks the waitress&apos; butt and rudely tells her to leave for he says that its time for man talk. The bartender is disgusted by this and tries to cut Tucker off,but Tucker just uses the waitress to get more booze. He insults the bartender,and when the bartender tries to go and beat him up,Dan steps up and intimidates the bartender with his imposing figure. Tucker then starts to persuade his friends to change the venue of the bachelor party. He wants to go to a strip club where &quot;there are no limits,and you&apos;re allowed to touch the strippers&quot;. Tucker tells them that it is in Salem,a town three hours away from where they are. Dan is reluctant but Tucker talks both Dan and Drew to go through with it. As they leave the bar,Tucker gloats to the bartender and yells that he fingered the waitress.Tucker drives Dan to his house where Dan&apos;s fiancÃÂ©e Kristy (Keri Lynn Pratt) is going through the seating chart. Kristy mentions that her mother is coming in that night which upsets Dan because Dan thinks that Kristy&apos;s parents make everything incredibly lame and wouldn&apos;t allow him to have a bouncy castle at their engagement party. He then packs to go to Salem for the bachelor party,which upsets Kristy. She asks why he always puts Tucker in front of her,which Dan points out is untrue. He lists all the things he sacrificed to be with Kristy and that he wants to have fun for once. The situation gets tense,and Tucker decides to go into the house. He notices the couple fighting and times his entrance. He makes it sound like Dan was lying about going to Salem and then promises Kristy that they wouldn&apos;t be going. He promises to have her back before she wakes up. However,as soon as they leave the house,Tucker starts driving to Salem.As they drive,Dan expresses the fact that he is uncomfortable lying to Kristy. Tucker dismisses it and the trio continues their drive. As they randomly converse,Drew starts to complain about his hunger and demands a pancake-wich. Tucker scoffs at Drew and Drew delivers a rant about how tasty the &apos;Pancake-wich&apos; is. They stop and get them and continue off to Salem.When they arrive,Tucker&apos;s first attempt at finding the strip club takes them to a crappy bar. Tucker shrugs off asking for directions by stating he was drunk the last time he visited the strip club. This assuages Dan&apos;s discomfort and the trio goes to a different bar. They quickly find another bar where a bachelorette party is being held. The trio makes friends with the group of ladies,but an uptight prude consistently annoys Tucker. Tucker insults her to the point where the other ladies become offended. That,combined with Drew&apos;s constantly misogynistic remarks,drives the girls away.After leaving the bar,the trio finds the strip club. A stripper goes over to Drew,but Drew easily scares her away with his casual comments about rape,murder and child abuse. As the trio drinks and engages in debauchery,one stripper named Lara (Marika Dominczyk) impresses Dan and Tucker by not only keeping up with Drew but brutally trumping Drews misogynistic insults with her own. Dan and Tucker are so impressed they pay her $200 to keep insulting Drew. After further rounds of insults,Lara challenges Drew to Halo,and goads him into leaving the bar with her. As Drew is preparing to leave,Kristy calls Dan. She and her mother are shopping for a bouncy castle and Kristy wants to know how the bachelor party is going. As they are talking,the announcer introduces the best stripper in Salem which Kristy hears and alarms her. She asks where they are and when Dan lies,he asks Tucker to back him up. Tucker instead has Drew take the phone and Drew flat out tells Kristy they went to Salem before leaving. Dan tries to do damage control,but it is clear Kristy is pissed off.Dan starts drinking out of anger with Tucker doing nothing to help. Tucker sees a girl and goes to hit on her,leaving Dan alone. Dan starts drinking when the proprietors of the club call him over since he is the bachelor of the night. Dan drunkenly stumbles over to the stage and a bunch of girls are about to give him a special dance. They grab his pants and Dan,shocked,elbows a girl in the nose. She bleeds and pushes him off the stage and he lands on a table with glasses. The bouncers throw him out of the club and Dan walks around in a drunken stupor. He eventually gets arrested for peeing on a dumpster and mocking a policeman.Meanwhile,Lara drives Drew to her place. Before they go inside,she tells them that she has a kid. They continue to trade insults,but Drew is visibly moved when he meets Lara&apos;s 10-year-old son,Jack. He teaches him how to set an L shaped ambush and the two bond. After Jack goes to bed,Lara beats Drew thoroughly at Halo. Drew tells her that she&apos;s doing a good job raising her kid by herself. Drew explains that as a child he was sent to his room and ignored by his parents. They come to understand one another and end up having sex.Dan,in the drunk tank,rants and raves about how he shouldnt be there. In his drunken state,he tries to organize a prison riot with the pendejos. Two cops enter the drunk tank and knock him out (giving him two black eyes to match his cut face). When Dan comes to,he has crusty vomit in his hair and most of the pendejos are gone. He tries calling Drew and Tucker,but they are both sleeping after getting laid. Dan calls Kristy,but Kristy&apos;s mother picks up and when he tells her that he is in jail,she just hangs up on him without telling Kristy what happened.The next day,Tucker picks up Drew and both find voicemails from Dan. They bail him out of jail and take him to get breakfast at a local diner where Tucker regales them with the tail of how he seduced the midget stripper and went to her place and had sex with her. When Tucker lets it slip that he had never been to the strip club before,Dan loses it. He expresses the fact that he may not even be engaged anymore because of Tuckers desire to sleep with a midget. Dan attacks Tucker,but Drew breaks up the fight. Dan takes a bus back to Kristy while Drew and Tucker drive back themselves.Dan begs Kristy for forgiveness and tells her that he&apos;s sorry. She takes him back and helps him clean up,but when her mother expresses disapproval,Kristy takes a stand and dismisses her mother. With the wedding a week away,the two get right down the business. Drew asks Tucker if he has apologized yet,but Tucker says that he will do it at the hotel before the wedding.One week later. Tucker,Drew,and Dan all prepare for the wedding separately and fly out to an Embassy Suites hotel before the wedding. Drew brings Lara and Jack as his guests. Tucker goes stag.. hoping to pick up and have sex at the wedding. Tucker goes to Dan and Kristy&apos;s room to apologize but Dan doesn&apos;t think its sincere. Dan shrugs it off with a whatever and leaves the hotel room. Kristy scolds Tucker and tells him that the apology wasn&apos;t sincere and that&apos;s why he was uninvited from the wedding. Tucker asks why she&apos;s uninviting him,but she makes it clear that she doesnt care if he&apos;s invited or not. This makes it clear that Dan is the one who doesn&apos;t want him at the wedding for what happened in Salem.Tucker,clearly a bit down,calls Drew to ask to go out drinking but Drew declines in order to see if his relationship with Lara can last. Tucker goes to a bar to drown his misery. He goes to a bar where he sees a young woman talking to a turtle. He asks if it is telling her to kill the fat girl by the bar,but when she gets upset,he says: &quot;why are you angry,fat girls arent real people?&quot; The girl by the bar hears that and Tucker and her get into an argument. When Tucker turns his back on her and places his drink on the bar,she puts eye drops into his drink (a la &apos;Wedding Crashers&apos;). The fat girl and her companion leave,while Tucker takes his drink and heads to the bathroom.While waiting in line,he notices a very attractive woman in a red dress who introduces herself as Connie (Traci Lords). They flirt and she mentions that she is married,but Tucker doesn&apos;t care and lets her drink some of his beer. They hook up in the bathroom and Tucker takes her back to his hotel room. However,before they can have sex the tainted beer takes hold. Connie goes into the bathroom and clogs the toilet with her massive diarrhea. She abruptly leaves,leaving Tucker with a desperate need to take a dump of his own.Tucker takes the elevator to the lobby and asks the manager for the bathroom. He runs in the large lobby and can&apos;t see where the bathroom is. He runs to what looks like the mens room door and sees the janitor in her office. She points him in the direction of the bathroom. He waddles toward it but only makes it half way as he starts to crap himself. He craps all over the floor until he makes it to the bathroom and clogs the first toilet. Once he moves over to the next stall,he sees that there is no toilet paper,so he uses his shirt to wipe himself. He leaves the bathroom naked and sees the janitor with tears in her eyes,looking at the crap spread all over the floor. Tucker then goes to the elevator and stares at his reflection,hoping that they serve beer in hell.The next morning,Dan gets married to Kristy. At the ceremony Dan&apos;s brother (played by the real Tucker Max),Dan&apos;s best man,gives a speech congratulating Dan. Tucker listens and then goes over and takes the mike from him and delivers a speech. He recounts the events in the lobby,and tells the crowd that he realized then that he never cleaned up his own shit before until the night before,when the maid went upstairs and made Tucker literally clean his own shit. He tells the crowd that Dan was his best friend and that he had been cleaning up Tucker&apos;s shit for a long time. He apologizes and brings the wedding parties outside to look at the large bouncy castle he ordered for Dan.Dan accepts Tucker&apos;s apology and he,Tucker and Drew jump into the bouncy castle. Afterwards,Drew calls &quot;bullshit&quot; on Tucker&apos;s story and Tucker tells his friends the real short story which is that instead of helping the janitor clean his shit,he just gave her money instead. Tucker then sees a hot blind girl and goes to seduce her and attain the Helen Keller. Dan says &quot;That&apos;s my cousin&quot; and he and Drew follow him.</Plot>

        <Plot>The third installment in the widely beloved Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga begins with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix),who,through a fast-paced prologue,gives the audience insight into the roots of his taste for adventure,fear of snakes,and dogged determination to take historical artifacts out of the hands of bad guys and into the museums in which they belong. A grown-up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene,teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry-eyed female college students in 1938. Once again,however,Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup — Indiana Jones&apos; father,Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) — who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody),a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she&apos;s an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest,and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record-breaking $50 million in its first week of release.</Plot>

        <Plot>Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is no ordinary archeologist. When we first see him,he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936,running a booby-trapped gauntlet (complete with an over-sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival,a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman),who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes,Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So,then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes,snakes. The next time we see Jones,he&apos;s a soft-spoken,bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis,it seems,are already searching for the Ark,which the mystical-minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark,Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy&apos;s old friend Abner Ravenwood,whose daughter,Marion (Karen Allen),evidently has a &quot;history&quot; with Jones. Whatever their personal differences,Indy and Marion become partners in one action-packed adventure after another,ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg,with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman,among others,Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate),Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989),as well as a short-lived TV-series &quot;prequel.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones epics is set a year or so before the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1984). After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river,Indy (Harrison Ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dimbulbed,easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (Kate Capshaw),and a feisty 12-year-old kid named Short Round (Quan Ke Huy). Throughout,the plot takes second place to the thrills,which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy&apos;s rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. There are also a couple of cute references to Raiders of the Lost Ark,notably a funny variation of Indy&apos;s shooting of the Sherpa warrior.</Plot>

        <Plot>In the small fishing town of Nightmute, Alaska, a local 17-year-old girl named Kay Connell (Crystal Lowe) is found murdered. Two LAPD detectives, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent up to assist the local police with their investigation.Concurrently, an intense Internal Affairs investigation back in Los Angeles is about to put Dormer under the microscope. Dormer is, in fact, guilty of planting false evidence against at least one suspect in this earlier case, a man named Dobbs. Certain that Dobbs was responsible for kidnapping and murdering a young boy, but realizing that there was not enough evidence to support a conviction, Dormer planted forensic evidence in Dobbs&apos; apartment. Dormer fears that many of his legitimate convictions will be overturned if Internal Affairs discovers that he falsified evidence in the Dobbs&apos; case. He does not want his life&apos;s work destroyed, nor does he want these criminals back on the streets. Early in the movie, Dormer&apos;s partner, Eckhart, reveals that Internal Affairs has offered him an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony. Dormer tries to talk Eckhart out of it, but Eckhart, apparently complicit to some degree in Dormer&apos;s misdeeds, says that ultimately he must look out for himself and his family first, so he feels he has no choice but to accept the deal.Focusing now on the Nightmute case, Dormer comes up with a clever plan to lure the murderer back to the scene of the crime. However, the stakeout attempt is blown, and the murder suspect flees into the fog, forcing the police to spread out and search for him on foot. During the pursuit, Dormer sees a figure through the fog, which he believes to be the armed murder suspect. He fires, and the figure collapses. However, when Dormer approaches, he discovers that he has mistakenly shot Eckhart. When Dormer realizes what he&apos;s done and tries to help, Eckhart turns away in horror, believing that Dormer shot him to prevent him from testifying in the Internal Affairs investigation. Eckhart dies moments later. As none of the other officers witnessed Eckhart&apos;s shooting, it is initially assumed that he was shot by the fleeing murder suspect.Given the nature of Eckhart&apos;s impending testimony, Dormer knows that Internal Affairs will never believe that the shooting was accidental. Thus, Dormer faces the dilemma of trying to bring the murder suspect to justice while at the same time cover up the truth about Eckhart&apos;s shooting and preserve the misconception that the murder suspect was responsible for that as well. Ellie Burr (Swank), a young police officer and Dormer&apos;s biggest fan, is put in charge of the investigation into Eckhart&apos;s shooting.Throughout the film, Dormer becomes more and more unhinged, partly because of feelings of guilt over shooting his partner and anxiety about the risk of being found out, partly because of insomnia brought on by the perpetual daylight of the Alaskan summer. Adding to his delirium are the phone calls he receives from Kay&apos;s killer, who does not identify himself, but who saw Dormer shoot Eckhart and knows about his attempt to cover it up. Dormer is aware that Kay was a fan of a crime writer named Walter Finch (Williams), and books autographed by him were found among her possessions. He discovers that Finch lives in Alaska, not far from the crime scene, and so starts to suspect Finch is the killer. He finds Finch&apos;s address and enters his apartment illegally. There, he finds his photo. Finch returns to his apartment while Dormer is there, realises Dormer has identified him, and flees. Dormer goes in pursuit, but Finch escapes.Finch contacts Dormer again, and they arrange to meet. Finch offers Dormer a deal, where Dormer is supposed to help frame Kay&apos;s abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) for the murder in exchange for Finch&apos;s silence about the Eckhart shooting. Finch secretly tape records their conversation, in order to give him hard evidence of Dormer&apos;s role in the shooting, as well as Dormer&apos;s attempt to cover it up. He then lets Dormer know he taped the conversation, a move designed to ensure Dormer&apos;s silence.Dormer seemingly agrees to the plan, though he&apos;s really just stalling for time. Unfortunately, Finch is impatient and manages to frame Randy all by himself. When Randy is arrested for murder, Dormer is forced to choose between destroying his own reputation and allowing an innocent man to be sent to prison.Meanwhile, Burr finds some inconsistencies in the Eckhart shooting: she finds a 9mm shell casing at the scene. Reading a case report on one of Dormer&apos;s old cases, she learns that Dormer carries a backup gun, a 9mm Walther, now leading her to suspect that Dormer shot his own partner. Later, while meeting with Finch at his cabin, Burr discovers the murder victim&apos;s dress. Realizing that Finch is the murderer, she reaches for her gun, but Finch knocks her unconscious. Dormer races to the cabin to confront Finch. It is clear that his concentration is nearly gone due to his lack of sleep. A brief fight ensues between Dormer and Finch, before Burr arrives and Finch escapes to his shed.Burr holds Dormer at gunpoint, revealing that she knows he shot Eckhart and demands to know whether he did it on purpose. Dormer breaks down, admitting that he shot his partner and stating that he is no longer certain whether it was an accident or not. From the protection of his shed, Finch fires at them with his shotgun. While Burr and Finch trade gunshots, Dormer sneaks around to Finch&apos;s location. In a twist of irony, Finch (fatally) shoots Dormer with Dormer&apos;s original weapon (which was taken from Dormer to investigate Eckhart&apos;s death), but Dormer quickly picks up the shotgun and blasts Finch at point blank in the stomach. A stunned Finch dies and tumbles into the water.Burr rushes to the detective&apos;s aid. She comforts Dormer by affirming that Eckhart&apos;s shooting was accidental, and tries to toss the evidence the 9mm shell casing found from the scene. Dormer stops Burr, telling her not to lose her way. &quot;Let me sleep,&quot; he asks, weakly, before finally dying. After a moment of contemplation, Burr slips the shell casing back into its plastic evidence bag.</Plot>

        <Plot>Just hours before his death,John F. Kennedy appeared before a crowd in Fort Worth,Texas to honor the freedoms of America in what would be his final speech. Though the Zapruder film,a silent,8mm home movie of the presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza,is the most complete visual recording of JFK s assassination,it is just part of a vast record of sights and sounds captured on camera that day. This four-hour special from HISTORYTM uses unique,rarely seen and heard footage to document the Kennedy assassination and the nearly 50 years of speculation and controversy that changed America. Home movies from eyewitnesses,Dallas police dispatch radio recordings,and raw news footage provide a shocking,unflinching look at the assassination of the president and the days that followed while examining the aftermath,and the enduring controversies,that emerged as succeeding generations of Americans struggled to comprehend the sudden murder of an unforgettable leader.</Plot>

        <Plot>Jackass Number Two is a compilation of various stunts,pranks and skits,and essentially has no plot. The film opens with an introduction of the nine cast members while they&apos;re being chased by bulls in a neighborhood. One by one,the cast members are taken down by the stampede,until only Johnny Knoxville and Bam Margera are left,and are chased through a house. Bam jumps through a window,and Johnny stops in his tracks to deliver his signature line,&quot;Hi,I&apos;m Johnny Knoxville,welcome to Jackass!&quot;,and is pushed through a window by several bulls,and the title comes to screen,&quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;.Leading up to the production number at the end,the following sequences and scenes are performed.1.

Bicentennial BMXing: Knoxville and Dunn attempt to perform stunts on 18th century style bicycles.6. The Strongman: Bam sits on top of a strength tester machine while Pontius sends a golden dildo rocketing towards his rear.

Gloria: Spike Jonze plays a 90-year old prostitute named Gloria who loses her top out on the street.8.

Rake Jump: Steve-O jumps on a rake for no apparent reason.20. Dave Eats Shit: The Three 6 Mafia pays Dave $200 to eat horse feces.

Riot Control Test: Knoxville returns to ALS Technologies and convinces Bam and Dunn to join him as test subjects for a Stingmore mine.23.

The Swamp Chute: Wee Man is launched off a dock using high powered fans.38. How to Milk a Horse: Knoxville,Pontius,and Steve-O obtain a sperm sample from a studded horse.

The Bear Trap: Knoxville puts his arm in a bear trap.The movie finishes with a Busby Berkeley-style movie musical production number set to the La Cage aux Folles song &quot;The Best Of Times&quot;,where the cast sing and dance while getting battered by violent stunts. One stunt involves Wee Man and Preston Lacy sliding onto a bunch of metal trash cans. Others involve Chris Pontius dancing in a flaming building and jumping safely onto a mat,at which point he is knocked off his feet by a fire hose,and Bam and Dunn dancing in cowboy outfits in front of a horse before Knoxville causes the horse to flee by slapping its rear,pulling Bam and Dunn away by a rope attached to their feet.

        <Plot>JUST VISITING is one very funny fish-out-of-water comedy the whole family will enjoy. It&apos;s 12th century France and Count Thibault of Malfete (Jean Reno, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE) finds his beautiful bride-to-be (Christina Applegate, TV&apos;s JESSE) done in by malevolent magic. So he and his loyal servant Andre (Christian Clavier, LES VISITEURS) request the help of a local wizard to right the wrong and bring his beloved back. But the wizardry goes awry and the pair is transported to 21st century Chicago where they meet Thibault&apos;s descendant Julia (Applegate) and her scheming fiance. With their timeless values of honor and courage, they wreak hilarious havoc as they foil diabolical plots in modern-day Chicago and try to find their way back home.</Plot>

        <Plot>Before the credits we learn that the film is about the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad,which has five members. A quotation gives the flavour: &quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold&quot;. In monochrome,a gasping,blood-covered bride (Uma Thurman) looks up from a chapel floor. A hand wipes her face using a handkerchief with the name Bill in the corner,while a male voice explains that what he is about to do is not a sadistic act,but a masochistic one. Just before he shoots her in the head,the Bride tells Bill (David Carradine) that the baby she carries is his. A gunshot is heard and the opening credits begin,backed by the song &quot;Bang Bang&quot;.Chapter 1: #2. Pasadena. A blonde woman,the Bride,draws up in a yellow and red pickup outside a suburban home and strolls to the front door. As she rings,a flashback shows the Bride crashing to the floor and looking up to see the face of one of her attackers,Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). As soon as the door is open,the Bride&apos;s fist crashes into Vernita&apos;s face. A savage fight follows,first with fists,then with knives. The fight pauses when a school bus draws up outside and a little girl walks through the door. The antagonists hide their knives and pretend nothing is amiss despite the wreckage around them. They both reassure the child,Nikki (Ambrosia Kelley). The Bride mentions that she used to have a child who would be the same age as Nikki (four). Vernita sends the girl to her room. At this point Vernita is introduced as a member of the Deadly Vipers,codename Copperhead. The Bride is also a member,codename Black Mamba. The Bride makes clear that she is here for revenge but promises not to kill Vernita in front of her child. They plan a fight later,but while Vernita is preparing cereal for her child she fires a concealed gun at the Bride. She misses and the Bride kills her with a thrown knife. The child walks in,a witness to her mother&apos;s death. The Bride apologises but explains that her mother had it coming to her. She tells Nikki that if,when she grows up,she can&apos;t get past the killing,she should come find the Bride. &quot;I&apos;ll be waiting,&quot; the Bride promises. She returns to the pickup,which is emblazoned with the words Pussy Wagon,crosses Vernita&apos;s name from a list headed &quot;Death List Five,&quot; and drives away.Chapter 2: The Blood Splattered Bride. Four years earlier in an El Paso wedding chapel,police are investigating a mass murder. The sheriff (Michael Parks) drives up and is told that there has been an execution-style massacre leaving nine bodies,including the bride,the groom,the preacher and his wife,the guests,and even the piano player. The sheriff strolls around commenting on the massacre,stops near the bride,and remarks on how good-looking she was. He immediately recognises the name she was using,Arlene Machiavelli,as an alias. As he kneels to look more closely at her,she suddenly (perhaps unintentionally) spits in his face. We see her rushed to a hospital,where she lies in a deep coma. A smartly dressed blonde woman walks through the hospital,whistling a tune. She finds a changing room and emerges dressed as a nurse with a red-cross patch over one eye and carrying a tray with a syringe. A title identifies her as Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) of the Deadly Vipers,codename California Mountain Snake. She stands over the comatose Bride and says that her gift is to allow her to die in her sleep. As she prepares to inject the contents of the syringe into the Bride&apos;s IV line,her mobile phone rings. It is Bill,who orders her to abort the mission in view of the Bride&apos;s survival of their previous efforts to assassinate her,and because it would lower them. Elle is furious,but does as ordered and leaves.On four years again and the Bride is still lying in a coma. A mosquito bites her and she sits up with a shriek. In a flashback she sees a gun pointing at her and a bullet approaching in slow motion. She begins to feel her body,first noticing the metallic sound of her skull and then feeling the absence of the baby in her womb. She shrieks again and sobs pitifully. When she hears approaching footsteps,she lies back and pretends to be still in a coma. An orderly (Michael Bowen) enters,accompanied by a large trucker (Jonathan Loughran). The orderly explains that,for $75,this attractive woman is available for whatever the trucker wants. The man pays up and is told that he can do anything as long as he doesn&apos;t leave any marks. The orderly leaves and the man climbs on top of the Bride. As he starts to kiss her she bites down on his lower lip and severs it in a profusion of blood. He&apos;s left unconscious or dead.The Bride tries to get out of bed but collapses as her legs will not support her. When she hears the orderly returning she picks up a knife and crawls behind the door. He enters and stands aghast at the carnage and the empty bed. She slashes his heel and he falls to the floor. Then,slamming the door into his head,she demands to know where Bill is. She reads the name Buck on the orderly&apos;s name tag,which triggers memories of his earlier assaults on her. She gives him a couple more violent blows with the door,perhaps killing him,then searches him for his car keys. The key fob says &quot;Pussy Wagon&quot; in distinctive pink script. Propelling herself to the basement car park in a wheelchair,the Bride is able to identify Buck&apos;s yellow pickup because it says &quot;Pussy Wagon&quot; on the back. She hauls herself in and starts the long process of getting her legs moving again.A shot of the rest of the Deadly Vipers gang introduces O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu),codename Cottonmouth,now head of the Tokyo yakuza.Chapter 3: The Origins of O-Ren Ishii. In anime format,the film follows O-Ren&apos;s development from the age of nine,when she witnessed the murder of her parents. She avenged the murder at 11 in blood-spouting style. She then developed into a world-class assassin. At 25 she was involved in the massacre of nine innocent people in El Paso,Texas. Her big mistake: she should have killed 10.Meanwhile 13 hours have passed and the Bride has regained use of her legs,so she sets out on her revenge trail. We see her flying to Okinawa.Chapter 4: The Man from Okinawa. The Bride enters a Japanese sushi bar and there is a longish scene with the jovial bar-keeper and some slapstick action with his assistant. Things get serious when she tells the bar-keeper that she is looking for him,Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). She explains that she needs some &quot;Japanese steel&quot; to kill vermin. He shows her to his attic where he keeps an array of the katanas (swords) he has made. When she tries one out he says that they are not for sale and he has sworn not to make any more &quot;instruments of death&quot;. She explains that her &quot;vermin&quot; is a former pupil of his and he correctly guesses that she means Bill. He agrees to make her a sword,which will take a month.A month later we see Hattori examining the new sword,which he believes is his finest work. He hands it to her.Chapter 5: Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves. The film returns to O-Ren and shows her as newly elected Head of the Council of all the yakuza bosses. When one objects to her elections on the grounds of her mixed-race origin (she is Chinese/Japanese-American),she immediately beheads him and warns the others never to mention her heritage in a negative way. We are introduced to O-Ren&apos;s lieutenants: her French-Japanese lawyer Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus),another of Bill&apos;s protégées; her teenage bodyguard Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama),sporting a plaid-skirted school uniform; and Johnny Mo (Chia Hui Liu,credited as Gordon Liu),the head of her strongarm men,the Crazy 88.The Bride flies into Tokyo and appears in yellow leathers and helmet riding a yellow motorbike while O-Ren and her motorcade are heading for a restaurant. The Bride spots Sofie in her car and there is a flashback to Sofie calmly taking a call on her mobile while the Bride and her party were being slaughtered. O-Ren and her immediate subordinates arrive at the restaurant and are ushered upstairs to a private dining room by the obsequious owners. At the bar,the Bride sits quietly and watches.O-Ren and her party are enjoying themselves when O-Ren hears or feels something threatening. She throws a small knife with a red tassel through the paper wall to lodge in a beam in the hallway outside,startling the Bride,who is lurking near the private room. O-Ren sends Gogo to look around,but the Bride has braced herself against the ceiling and Gogo doesn&apos;t see her. The Bride enters the toilet and while stripping off her leathers,hears the distinctive ring-tones of Sofie&apos;s mobile. With Sofie in tow,the Bride loudly announces her presence from the restaurant floor,which brings O-Ren and her party rushing out onto the balcony. While they watch she slashes off one of Sofie&apos;s arms and pandemonium ensues as the diners and staff flee. O-Ren sends her lieutenants down singly or in groups to kill the Bride,but all end up dead. The final defender is Gogo,who opposes the Bride&apos;s sword with a ball and chain in a vicious fight,ending when the Bride kills Gogo by embedding a broken,nail-studded table leg in her temple. Before O-Ren and the Bride can engage,the roar of motorbikes is heard and the Crazy 88 pour in. The ensuing battle of one against many is long,balletic and bloody but finally only one of the 88 remains -- the youngest -- and the Bride sends him off with a spanking. She announces to the defeated Crazy 88 that they may leave,but they must leave behind their severed limbs,which belong to her now. She tells Sofie to stay.Outside in the snow,the Bride and O-Ren fight it out in a long and evenly-matched sword-fight. At the start of the fight,O-Ren casts doubt on the provenance of the Bride&apos;s sword. The Bride wins by slicing off the top of O-Ren&apos;s head; before she dies,O-Ren remarks that the sword must really be a Hanzo. Later,the Bride crosses O-Ren&apos;s name from her list.The Bride loads Sofie into a car and drives to a point where she can roll her down a snowy slope to a hospital. As the Bride draws up her &quot;Death List Five,&quot; we see Sofie,in monochrome,talking to someone whose face is not seen but who is clearly Bill. She tells Bill that under threat of having more limbs cut off,she has told the Bride everything she knows. She explains that the Bride kept her alive just so she could tell Bill in person all that happened and warn him that soon all of them would be dead. Bill&apos;s final words are &quot;Is she aware that her daughter is still alive?&quot;To be continued....</Plot>

        <Plot>During the opening credits,we see the Bride&apos;s bloodied face again and hear her say &quot;Bill,it&apos;s your baby.&quot; In the first scene,we see her driving an open car and saying that there is only one left to kill (which answers the question whether she believed that Elle died). She is on her way to Bill.Chapter 6: The Massacre at Two PinesBack at the beginning (a black-and-white segment),at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel in El Paso,TX,a dress rehearsal for a wedding is taking place. Reverend Harmony (Bo Svenson) and his wife (Jeannie Epper) decide that,since the bride will have no relatives present at the wedding,the groom&apos;s relatives and friends can sit on both sides of the aisle. The Bride (Uma Thurman) leaves the chapel to get some fresh air; on the way out,she is disturbed to hear flute music. On the front porch she finds Bill (David Carradine) sitting on a bench playing his bamboo flute. She asks him to be nice and he replies that he does not know how to be nice but will do his best to be sweet. They enter the hall and she introduces Bill to her fiancé as her father but rejects the fiancé&apos;s idea that,as her father,he should give her away at the ceremony. As the bride and groom are called to the front by the Reverend Harmony,no attempt is made to introduce &apos;father&apos; to the rest of the fiancé&apos;s family. Bill stays at the back of the chapel.Outside the chapel,four armed assassins appear,all dressed in black. In one line they move to the door,they enter,and the shooting starts,killing everybody inside except for the Bride and Bill.Back in the present (in color),Bill visits his younger brother Budd (Michael Madsen),a.k.a. Sidewinder,at his trailer in the middle of nowhere and warns him about the Bride. She will kill Budd if Budd does not allow Bill to protect him. They had differences in the past but they should move on. Budd,drinking as they talk,replies that maybe they should get killed because the Bride deserves her revenge. He then infuriates Bill by saying that he pawned his priceless samurai sword (a gift from Bill) for $250.Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula SchulzBudd goes to work. He works as a bouncer in a local strip club. He arrives 20 minutes late and sees that there are no customers in the club. He talks briefly with the bartender,Jay,before he is called into the office by his hot-tempered,coke-snorting boss Larry Gomez. In the office,Larry argues with Budd over being late again,and Budd talks back,saying that there is nobody in the bar &amp; there was no need for him to be there. Larry takes away all Budd&apos;s scheduled hours and tells him in a rude tone not to come back to work until he hears from him. In the bar,Budd agrees to clean up after a broken toilet that a stripper named Rockets says is overflowing.Budd returns to his trailer but standing in front of it suddenly freezes. He enters the trailer but looks out the window. The Bride,who was hiding under the trailer,sticks to the wall so he does not see her. When she opens the door Budd shoots her in the chest with a shotgun loaded with rock salt. While she lies wounded on the ground,Budd is very pleased with himself and injects her with a sedative. He phones Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and offers to sell her the Bride&apos;s Hattori Hanzo sword for a million dollars. Elle agrees to bring the money in the morning. Her condition is that the Bride must die and suffer to her last breath.Budd and an accomplice of his dig a large hole in the ground at a local cemetery to bury the wounded Bride alive. When the grave has been dug,the Bride is given a choice: if she does not resist,she&apos;ll be given a flashlight; if she does,Budd will burn out her eyes with mace and leave her buried alive in darkness. She chooses the flashlight,is put in a coffin and the lid is nailed down. Budd and his accomplice lower the coffin into the ground and cover it with soil. The Bride panics for a short time and recalls her training under Pai Mei.Chapter 8: The Cruel Tutelage of Pai MeiIn a flashback,Bill and the Bride (very much in love with him) sit by a campfire somewhere in China and Bill,who calls her &quot;kiddo,&quot; plays his flute. He tells her about his kung fu teacher Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu,credited as Gordon Liu) and his &apos;five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique.&apos; The technique involves five blows administered to particular pressure points on the body. Thereafter,the victim&apos;s heart explodes after he or she takes five steps. Pai Mei did not teach Bill the technique because he does not show it to anyone.At the foot of the steps leading to Pai Mei&apos;s place in another part of rural China,Bill,who has just come down,informs the Bride that Pai Mei will take her as his pupil because he is lonely. Bill&apos;s bruised face shows that he was hurt but he refuses to say what happened. Bill warns her not to show any disrespect or disobedience to Pai Mei because Pai Mei will kill her -- &quot;he hates Caucasians,despises Americans,and has nothing but contempt for women.&quot; She climbs the steps and quickly is humiliated by Pai Mei,who scorns her fighting skills and her ethnicity. He challenges her to land one blow on him while they engage in hand-to-hand combat and the Bride fails. Pai Mei threatens to chop her hand off with a single blow and declares that her hand belongs to him and she must strengthen it. Over the next several weeks,the Bride works hard (practicing martial arts forms and bringing buckets of water up the steps) and learns hard. She finds striking a blow with her fist to break a hole through a thick wooden plank at close range the most difficult skill.Back to the present. Still inside the coffin,the Bride manages to remove her boots and the belt tying her feet together. She takes out a straight razor hidden in her boot and uses it to cut her hands free. She hits the coffin lid with her fist repeatedly. The lid becomes smeared with her blood but it finally cracks. She appears to swim up through the earth,and an arm emerges from the grave. The Bride crawls out. Covered in dirt,she walks into a diner,sits down and calmly asks for a glass of water.Chapter 9: Elle and IThe Bride walks a great distance across the desert and through the mountains. She reaches Budd&apos;s trailer in time to see Elle arrive.Elle enters the trailer and gives Budd a red suitcase full of money. He makes margaritas in a grubby blender and serves them in dirty jelly-jar glasses while she examines the sword. He opens the suitcase,gloats over the money,and is struck in the face by a venomous black mamba snake that was hidden among the bundles of cash. Before he dies,Elle tells him that she is sorry that such a &quot;piece of shit&quot; as himself was the one who managed to kill the Bride -- she deserved better. She phones Bill and tells him that the Bride has killed his brother but that she,Elle,has killed the Bride. Elle also reveals the whereabouts of the final resting place of the Bride (in the grave of Paula Schulz) and mentions the Bride&apos;s real name for the first time: Beatrix Kiddo.Beatrix walks in and immediately attacks Elle. Their long and vicious fight destroys the trailer&apos;s interior. In a lull in the hostilities,Beatrix asks Elle how she lost her eye and Elle says that Pai Mei ripped it out because she offended him. Elle tells Beatrix that she poisoned Pai Mei in revenge and he died. They continue to fight and Elle gets hold of the Bride&apos;s sword. In a golf bag,the Bride finds another katana,inscribed &quot;To my brother Budd,the only man I ever loved,Bill&quot; -- apparently Budd did not sell it after all. As they face off,Elle relishes the irony of killing the Bride with her own sword. However,at close range,the Bride plucks out Elle&apos;s remaining eye and steps on it. Rather than finish killing Elle,Beatrix leaves the trailer,the black mamba hissing behind her as Elle shrieks and curses and flails.Last Chapter: Face to FaceIn Mexico,the Bride visits the courtly retired pimp Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks),Bill&apos;s old mentor,and asks him to tell her where Bill is. He finally agrees because he thinks Bill would surely like to see her.She enters Bill&apos;s hacienda carefully,a gun in her hand,but is shocked to the point of tears when Bill and their small daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine),alive,both play-shoot at her with toy guns. She spends good time with her daughter,who falls asleep. The Bride goes to speak to Bill.Bill&apos;s warning shot pins Beatrix down in her seat,then he shoots her with a truth-serum dart. She explains why she left him: because she wanted to keep their child safe,not wanting her to grow up to be assassins like them.Flashback to a hotel room: the Bride,who&apos;s been sent on an assassination assignment to Japan,discovers that she is pregnant. Another assassin,Karen Kim (Helen Kim),shoots a hole in the door with a shotgun. The Bride,pointing her gun at Karen,convinces her that she is pregnant and persuades her to walk away,promising that she will do the same. As she leaves,Karen congratulates the Bride.Back in the present,Bill is puzzled because he believes that Beatrix is a natural born killer and could not change. He asks if she enjoyed killing the other people on her revenge list,and the truth serum forces her to admit that she did. They agree to fight with swords on the beach -- then Bill suddenly attacks her as they sit on his patio. At the climax of a brief skirmish during which both remain seated,she strikes him with the five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique. She tells Bill that she did not mention that Pai Mei taught her the technique because she is a bad person. Bill disputes that. They share an affectionate farewell before he takes five steps and falls down dead.Beatrix takes her daughter away to start a new life: &quot;The lioness has rejoined her cub,and all is right in the jungle.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>This is a wonderful yet heartrending period piece,as told by an elderly Native American through a collection of family letters he accumulated and saved over time.The right and proper Colonel William Ludlow,(Anthony Hopkins),a veteran of the Native American wars that took place in the late 19th century,has grown tired of the carnage and futility of war. Moreover,he detests the governments and their greed that propagated the battles he has fought. In the opening sequence,the teepees have been struck,the fires,billowing white smoke as they symbolically die out,along with the hope and freedom of &quot;the People.&quot;At first glance,the viewer might believe he is observing the remnants of the Coronel&apos;s last battle. Then a child is seen by his side,and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor,but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the People,and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point. He tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust,viewing his humbled former enemy,and turns his back to the camera,and on his former life. The scene is similar to &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; in that the Native Americans,those who survived,are seen defeated and disheartened,abandoning what was once their home. The look on the &quot;victorious&quot; Colonel&apos;s face as he views his one time enemies says it all.Hopkins takes his wife,(Cristina Pickles) three sons,(Brad Pitt,Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas),and trusted Cree guide,One Stab,(excellent perfomance by Gordon Tootoosis,who also narrates),and his family on a quest to &quot;lose the madness over the mountains and begin again.&quot; Although filmed almost entirely in British Columbia,the setting for the film is the mountains near Helena,Montana. The scenery alone is reason enough to let yourself become lost in this film; temporarily lost from the madness.The story unfolds as the boys are still in their teens,and the youngest of the three,Samuel,(Thomas),is constantly being watched over &quot;like a treasure&quot; by Alfred,(Quinn),the oldest,&quot;even old for his years,&quot; and the Colonel&apos;s favorite,the wild and fearless Tristan (Pitt). Their mother has decided to leave the ranch,citing the winters as too cruel,as well as being afraid of the bears. &quot;She was always a strange woman anyway,&quot; Tootoosis growls in that keenly authentic accent,then goes on to say that &quot;Alfred writes her often,but Tristan will not speak of her.&quot; This sets the tone for how even the strongest of family ties can be as fragile as glass. The Colonel is then seen writing one of the many letters One Stab has in his possession,dated April,1913,a year before the beginning of &quot;the Great War,&quot; (WWI).Corresponding with her husband,Mrs. Ludlow tells the Colonel their youngest son will be returning from Harvard the following Summer,and he will be accompanied by his new fiancée,the dazzling Julia Ormond as Susannah Fincannon. From the moment she and Samuel step from the train,the reaction to her beauty and grace by both the Colonel and Alfred,the viewer begins to sense discord on the horizon. Alfred is clearly taken by her,but the attention shifts quickly away to the absence of Tristan. After introductions,Samuel asks where his brother is,and Alfred scoffs &quot;Ah,he&apos;s off somewhere,you know him.&quot; Hopkins&apos; Colonel Ludlow chimes in with authority &quot;Well,he&apos;ll be here tonight to welcome his brother home or I&apos;ll know the reason why.&quot;The following scenes find the brothers reacquainting themselves with one another,and,it is clear,the two older brothers are more than impressed with young Samuel&apos;s betrothed. Observing this,Hopkins,as only he can,delivers one of the few humorous lines in the film; embarrassing Alfred by catching him off-guard,standing out of sight,he admonishes him from the porch of the ranch: &quot;Alfred! Stop mooning over Miss Fincannon and get in here.&quot;As the group seem to be settling in for what one thinks will be a love story set entirely at the ranch,shortly after a scene in which Samuel sings with a certain boyish quality,perhaps a hint of naiveté lingering in his voice,news of the British troops being cut off in Belgium arrives. Samuel is quick to point out to his father that with his fluent German,he could become an officer. Samuel goes on to say that they&apos;re &quot;out here in the middle of nowhere while all this is going on!&quot; Hopkins&apos; Colonel Ludlow,becoming annoyed at the topic of war being discussed under his roof,replies &quot;And thank God for that.&quot;To prove to his father,his brothers,his soon to be bride,and perhaps more than anyone,himself,that he no longer needs protecting and is indeed,a man,Samuel announces he&apos;s going to Canada to enlist. Alfred immediately proclaims he will accompany his brother. The camera briefly focuses on Pitt,and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation; his future has just changed and he&apos;s not exactly pleased.Later the same evening,Susannah is being comforted by Tristan,holding her as she cries over the prospect of her beloved Samuel unnecessarily going off to war. As Tristan is whispering in her ear that he&apos;ll protect his younger brother,Alfred happens upon the scene,and gets the impression the embrace between the two was more than just for comfort. Thus begins the tear in the bond of brotherhood once so strong nothing could come between them.What follows is at times predicable,but the rest makes up for the few parts the viewer can see coming and then some. The story is an epic tale of right and wrong,family,love,and how life can be at once beautiful and unrelentingly cruel,especially where matters of the heart are concerned. This is an unjustly overlooked piece of celluloid,worthy of many more accolades it originally received. Frankly,while some may argue &quot;Kalifornia&quot; or &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; had already accomplished this,I think &quot;Legends&quot; established Pitt as a more talented and serious actor than his previous work.The performances,(how can anyone go wrong with such brilliant casting?),the score,cinematography (Oscar winning),are all first rate,and the story will take you from wherever you are,to a time when the pace of life was slower,and things were easier... or were they?</Plot>

        <Plot>The island of Iwo Jima stands between the American military force and the home islands of Japan. Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.</Plot>

        <Plot>Capturing the danger and excitement of political intrigue, Steven Spielberg&apos;s Lincoln chronicles the final four months in the life of the man regarded as America&apos;s greatest President. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role, the untold story focuses on a defining moment in Abraham Lincoln&apos;s life - as commander-in-chief of a country in chaos; as a husband and father afraid of losing his own son to the war; and as a man guided by his conscience to end slavery. With the Civil War nearing conclusion, President Lincoln fights to convince a fractious Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment that will change the course of history. Facing fierce opposition, he wages a battle of strategy, persuasion, and political muscle to build a coalition out of his team of rivals.</Plot>

        <Plot>Hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long),not knowing who he is working for,finishes work on a computer program and sends it to Mai Linh (Maggie Q),who advises her boss and lover,Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant),that they can now proceed with their evil plan. The criminal mastermind begins killing the hackers he hired by exploding their computers by means of a virus he has implanted,and commencing the initial stages of a computer attack on US government networks.Meanwhile,a young couple is making out in a car at Rutgers University in New Jersey. New York City Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) breaks it up; the girl turns out to be his estranged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She leaves in a huff,refusing to acknowledge her father&apos;s last name but calling herself instead by her mother&apos;s maiden name,Gennero. Simultaneously,the FBI command center&apos;s computers are momentarily interrupted,leading Deputy Director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) to order a roundup of all the hackers who could conceivably have been involved. McClane is sent to pick up Farrell in Camden,and his arrival interrupts the hacker just before he performs the operation which would detonate his computer. Gabriel&apos;s assassins,who had the apartment under surveillance to confirm Farrell&apos;s death,open fire. McClane kills several thugs who enter the apartment. Debris from the shootout sets off the explosion of Farrell&apos;s computer,destroying the apartment. McClane and Farrell escape down the fire escape,McClane killing various henchmen on the way and Farrell astonished by McClane&apos;s calmness during the ordeal.As McClane makes it to Washington,D.C. with his charge,Gabriel sabotages the nation&apos;s network of traffic signals,rail transport and air traffic control. Chaos on the roads ensues. Gabriel also forces the evacuation of numerous federal buildings with a false anthrax alarm,with some of his men infiltrating a Maryland facility by posing as a hazmat cleanup team. After arriving at the temporary FBI office,Farrell recognizes the pictures of the dead hackers on the wall,but denies knowing who they are. Gabriel broadcasts a message threatening the nation,using spliced video clips of the last twelve presidents,and then sabotages the nation&apos;s financial systems. Farrell and McClane are redirected by the FBI to the Department of Homeland Security so that Farrell can be interrogated. While they are on their way,Gabriel begins downloading a huge quantity of significant data from the Maryland facility onto his own computers. McClane,Farrell,and their FBI escort attempt to contact the police to have a route opened for them,but have their radio communication intercepted by Gabriel and Linh,who direct them to an ambush. McClane suspects their communication has been intercepted,tests Linh by asking her a trick question,and reveals he knows she&apos;s a fake. Gabriel gets on the radio and advises McClane he knows everything about him,wipes out his financial portfolio,and offers him a bribe to kill Farrell; McClane refuses,and Gabriel vows revenge. Our heroes attempt to evade the ambush,but are set upon by helicopter. McClane and Farrell escape the ambush in a police car,and are chased into a tunnel by the helicopter. Gabriel opens the traffic on both sides of the tunnel,sandwiching our heroes in a massive pileup in the middle. McClane drives straight out of the tunnel and jumps at the last second before launching the car up a toll barrier into the helicopter,killing most of the thugs; the one survivor mistakenly tells Gabriel that their targets have been killed.McClane and Farrell escape on foot,but as they try to contact the FBI via cell phone,they discover that Gabriel has also sabotaged the telecommunications networks. Gabriel then takes over the nation&apos;s television signals,and broadcasts the demolition of the U.S. Capitol building; Bowman and McClane each run into the street for a clear view,and see that the footage was faked. Farrell admits that he recognized some of the dead hackers from their pictures,and that he innocently wrote some code that may be being used in this computer attack,which appears to be a three-stage plan to cripple the United States,beginning with attacks on its transportation and financial infrastructures. The third stage will be to take out the power grid; this cannot be done remotely but requires intervention at the actual physical plants. Farrell confesses that he had always viewed hacking as harmless pranks,but is now horrified by the actual damage and suffering caused; he reconfigures the cell phone to use a different network to allow them to communicate. McClane and Farrell commandeer an abandoned car. By pretending to be the son of its owner in a medical emergency,Farrell gets OnStar to remotely start it for them. They set off for the main power station in West Virginia which controlls the Eastern seaboard. Farrell,who tends to avoid taking action by citing numerous minor medical conditions and phobias,admits to McClane that he doesn&apos;t feel capable of heroism.Linh and a group of henchmen,disguised as FBI agents,infiltrate and take over the power station. As they commence shutdown procedures,McClane and Farrell arrive. Their presence is detected,and henchmen are dispatched to kill them. McClane and Farrell fight their way to the station&apos;s command center,McClane fights Linh,and Farrell manages to abort the shutdown sequence. McClane finally kills Linh by driving a truck into her and down an elevator shaft,where the truck explodes at the bottom. Farrell saves McClane by killing one thug,knocking him from behind down the shaft. Seeing that the shutdown hasn&apos;t taken place yet,Gabriel calls Linh&apos;s cell phone. McClane answers and tells Gabriel that his plan has been foiled and Linh killed. Enraged,Gabriel redirects all the natural gas in the pipelines to converge on the power station. Farrell notices this on one of the computer screens,and he and McClane take shelter just before the station explodes. Gabriel once again believes the pair to be dead. The destruction of the station causes a massive power blackout over Washington and much of the Eastern seaboard. Lucy McClane is caught in an elevator in the blackout.Farrell and McClane decide to visit &quot;The Warlock&quot; (Kevin Smith) in Baltimore,who Farrell describes as an &quot;Internet Jedi.&quot; Traffic being a nightmare,McClane chooses to fly the helicopter that Linh and her henchmen had used to arrive at the power station. McClane reveals he had a few flying lessons,but never completed the course; they have a rough landing in Baltimore. Meanwhile,Gabriel and a few select henchmen kill his other remaining computer engineers to eliminate witnesses and,travelling light,set out in a semi-trailer with a mobile computer command center in the back.The Warlock lives in his mother&apos;s basement where he has set up his own &quot;command center&quot; -- an impressive collection of computers running on his own generators,interspersed with geek memorabilia. The Warlock is suspicious of the police,but reluctantly agrees to help. He reveals that Gabriel was formerly a highly-placed FBI computer security director,responsible for building much of the system,who discovered its vulnerabilities to attack. When Gabriel brought these vulnerabilities to the attention of his supervisors,ultimately interrupting a meeting of the Joint Chiefs to do so,he was denounced and publicly humiliated. The Warlock tells Farrell that he has been examining the type of code he was hired to write,and that it is only being used at one facility - the one in Maryland,which is still running and drawing massive power loads. Gabriel is alerted to Warlock&apos;s intrusions; he traces the intrusion back to Warlock&apos;s basement command center,and commandeers Warlock&apos;s computer and web cam to communicate with McClane. He shows McClane images of his daughter in the elevator,and advises that he is going to get her. McClane sets off to find and kill Gabriel; he tells Farrell to stay behind,but Farrell insists on helping him. Under the ruse of a rescue,Lucy is brought to Gabriel at the data facility; a chip off the old block,she fights all the way before being tied up.McClane and Farrell communicate with Bowman and show him an image of Gabriel. Bowman is dismayed; he tells them that the facility still running,part of the National Security Agency,was designed by Gabriel as a failsafe in the event of an attack on the nation&apos;s infrastructure. The initial attack on the FBI had triggered the download to that facility of all the financial data from stock markets,corporations,and government agencies. Gabriel apparently intends to download this information onto mobile hard drives,allowing him to undetectably siphon off billions of dollars.McClane and Farrell head to the data facility,but Gabriel is alerted to their presence. Farrell realizes that the code he wrote was designed to defeat the security at the last door to the facility&apos;s main databanks and,slipping in as McClane distracts Gabriel&apos;s men,manages to encrypt all the data that Gabriel has downloaded,making it useless to them without the decryption key which he alone knows. He is subsequently captured by Gabriel&apos;s thug and brought to the control center where Lucy is also captive. When he suggests to Lucy that she needs to be less confrontational with their heavily armed adversaries,Lucy tells him he needs to show more bravery and resolve. McClane kills the various thugs sent to stop him,and communicates with Farrell via one of the thugs&apos; walkie-talkies. Gabriel attempts to talk McClane down but is unable to do so. He puts Lucy on the radio,to &quot;talk some sense&quot; into her father,but she aids him by telling him that there are only five bad guys left. The bad guys escape in two vehicles: Gabriel,two thugs,and the captives in an emergency services van,and one thug in a semi-trailer carrying their portable computer control center. McClane jumps onto the back of the semi-truck as it leaves the facility,climbs to the cab,shoots the driver through the door,and gives chase to the remaining bad guys and their captives in the van. In the van,Gabriel orders Farrell to unlock the data,but Farrell refuses,knowing that this is his only bargaining chip and that Gabriel will kill him once he has the data back. Bowman orders an F-35 fighter plane dispatched to intercept the van after McClane contacts him via Warlock&apos;s CB radio link.Gabriel realizes they are being chased. He obtains the go codes for the fighter plane by accessing the military&apos;s data banks,and impersonates military commanders to order the pilot to destroy the semi-truck. The F-35 fires various missiles and artillery at the truck,causing McClane to break off his chase and move to a ramp leading to a bridge. The F-35 virtually destroys the truck and a large portion of the ramp. As the truck begins to slide backwards down the destroyed ramp,McClane falls out of the cab and down the back of the ravaged trailer. The plane,now just next to the truck,is about to deliver the coup de grace when it is damaged by a chunk of falling pavement. McClane falls onto the plane&apos;s wing. The pilot ejects,and McClane slides down the spiralling plane and jumps onto another section of destroyed ramp,sliding down the ramp as the jet crashes and explodes just behind him.The van carring the bad guys and captives enters a warehouse. McClane pursues them. Gabriel orders Farrell to enter the code to decrypt the information. Farrell refuses and is shot in the knee by Gabriel. When Gabriel puts the gun to Lucy&apos;s head and says he will count to ten before killing her,Farrell gives in despite her pleas to resist,and begins to enter the code. McClane arrives and kills one of the henchmen,but is in turn shot in the shoulder by Gabriel. McClane dives behind a car,his gun on the ground near Farrell. McClane goes for his gun but is grabbed by Gabriel from behind. Standing behind McClane,Gabriel taunts him and tortures him by sticking his gun into the bullet wound in McClane&apos;s shoulder. Lucy struggles with the thug holding her,shooting him in the foot before he recovers his grip on her. Gabriel tells McClane that his epitaph will read &quot;Always in the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot; McClane replies that it might read &quot;Yippee ki yay,mother-&quot; and pulls the trigger,shooting himself through the shoulder and killing Gabriel. Farrell has grabbed McClane&apos;s gun and shoots the other thug.The FBI arrive and provide medical attention to McClane,Lucy,and Farrell. Farrell and Lucy separately indicate to McClane their romantic interest in each other. Lucy indicates that,for today at least,she&apos;s a McClane.</Plot>

Aubrey and the Surprise&apos;s current orders are to track and capture or destroy a French privateer named Acheron. The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleon&apos;s reach of the wars. This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise,which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage. Aubrey&apos;s single-mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surprise&apos;s doctor and naturalist,Stephen Maturin,who is also Aubrey&apos;s most trusted advisor on board and closest friend.

        <Plot>The story,set in the American Old West,is a first-person account by a wisecracking gambler &apos;Bret Maverick&apos; (Mel Gibson),of his misadventures on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. Besides wanting to win the poker championship for the money,he also wants to prove,once and for all,that he is &apos;the best&apos;. However,complications keep getting in the way.Maverick rides into the fictional town of Crystal River intending to collect money owed to him,as he is $3000 short of the poker tournament entry fee of $25,000. His efforts to make up this $3000 provide some plot motivation,as well as diversions caused by,and in the company of,three people he encounters at Crystal River-an antagonist named Angel (Alfred Molina),a young con-artist calling herself Mrs Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster),and legendary lawman Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner,who played Bret Maverick in the original TV series). The first two are also rival poker players.Maverick,Bransford and Cooper share a stagecoach (the driver of which dies at the reins at full gallop),agree to help a wagon train of migrant evangelist settlers who have been waylaid by ruffians (for a fee which Maverick in the end is too big-hearted to accept) and are headed-off by a troop of Indians led by &quot;Joseph&quot; (Graham Greene). Unknown to his companions,Joseph and Maverick are good friends,and Maverick allows himself to be &quot;captured.&quot; Joseph is another one of his unreliable debtors,and in and around his tribal grounds they collaborate on a scheme to swindle a Russian Grand Duke.During this time,Angel has received a mysterious telegram ordering him to not allow Maverick to reach the poker game,and has also learned that Maverick had conned him in Crystal River. These scenes are some of the very few which do not involve Maverick directly. Angel catches up with Maverick after he has left Joseph&apos;s tribe,beats him up and attempts to hang him. Despite being tied to both a tree and to his horse,Maverick escapes and reaches the poker game-on a paddle steamer-safely. Bransford and Angel have also reached the game,and Cooper who is engaged to ensure the security of the game.After preliminary rounds,the four finalists are Maverick,Bransford,Angel,and the Commodore of the boat (James Coburn). Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 5:00am deadline,having had his stateroom door chained (by an unknown person) after a short tryst with Bransford. The game proceeds,with Bransford the first eliminated,and shortly thereafter a &quot;fixed&quot; hand is dealt to the three remaining players. The Commodore is given four 8s and Angel is given a low straight flush,whilst Maverick has the 10,Jack,Queen and King of Spades. The Commodore and Angel each bet &quot;all in&quot; (inferring that Maverick is the chip leader at this stage). Maverick observes the dealer bottom-dealing to the others,protests the conduct of the hand,and eventually accepts one card dealt by Angel and calls the bets without checking the card. It is,melodramatically,the Ace of Spades (Note that a 9 of Spades would also have won the hand for Maverick). An enraged Angel draws his gun but he,and his stooges in the audience,are gunned down in rapid succession by Cooper and Maverick (drawing one of Cooper&apos;s guns).Three plot twists follow Maverick&apos;s win: Firstly,Cooper steals the $500,000 prize money instead of presenting it to Maverick. Secondly,it is revealed that the Commodore and Cooper were secretly in cahoots on the theft and that Angel had actually been working for the Commodore. Thirdly,Maverick ambushes the two around a campfire and steals back the money. He leaves them with a single gun to settle their affairs. Cooper beats up the Commodore and angrily vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Maverick,even if it means hunting him to the ends of the earth.Later,Maverick is relaxing in a bath-house when Cooper finds him,and drops the facade to reveal (to the audience) that he is in fact Maverick&apos;s father. It is also revealed that the real conspiracy was between the two of them. Suddenly,however,Bransford enters the bath-house and robs Cooper and Maverick (whose relationship she had easily surmised). However,she only gets away with half of the money she had expected,as Maverick had hidden the rest in his boots. Maverick smiles and comments that it will be a lot of fun getting the rest of the money back from her.</Plot>

        <Plot>In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite law enforcing squad &quot;Precrime&quot;. They use three genetically altered humans (called &quot;Pre-Cogs&quot;) with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system&apos;s flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse,Anderton doesn&apos;t even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery&apos;s core by finding out the &apos;minority report&apos; which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that &quot;might&quot; tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.</Plot>

        <Plot>Sophisticated New York couple David and Annie Smith have an unusual marriage with an inordinate number of rules and regulations. One rule entitles them to ask each other one question per month which the other must answer completely honestly. Annie asks David if he would marry her again if he could have the time over again and David confides that he misses his freedom and so probably wouldn&apos;t. Later that day,an official from the town where they got married calls to see David. He explains that owing to a state boundary dispute,all couples married between 1936 and 1939 in the county were not legally married. David decides to have fun with this fact,but unbeknown to him,the county official calls to see Annie too and disaster results.</Plot>

        <Plot>This movie is a complete spoof of the Freddie Prinz/Rachel Leigh Cook movie &quot;She&apos;s All That.&quot; It is a great takeoff with lines appropriately modified to fit the satire genre and even includes a word for word reference to one of Freddie&apos;s lines in the original movie. From the minute I started watching this flick,I knew exactly what it was about and exactly where it was going. It was corny,but I enjoyed every minute of it.</Plot>

        <Plot>Daniel Ocean (George Clooney),a convicted thief,is being questioned by a parole board about his coming release from prison. He claims a reason for his crime was that his wife,Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts),left him,and when asked what he would do if released from prison,there is no answer.Ocean is paroled from his New Jersey prison harboring dreams of revenge on Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia),the man who stole his ex-wife. Benedict owns three Las Vegas casino-hotels: the Bellagio,the Mirage,and the MGM Grand. All three casinos share one vault,and Ocean plans to assemble a crew to take advantage of this.His first recruit is old friend and blackjack dealer Frank Catton (Bernie Mac),in Atlantic City. Next,he&apos;s off to Hollywood (breaking the terms of his parole,which require him to stay in New Jersey) to reunite with his right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). Rusty is skeptical of Danny&apos;s plan but pledges his support and his valuable insight. Together he and Danny go over exactly who they will need in their crew and who they will get to finance the operation. The financier turns out to be the flamboyantly wealthy Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). Reuben is not interested at first; he says the scheme is unlikely to succeed because of the outrageously tight security around casino vaults. He changes his mind when he learns the target is Benedict,an old enemy of his.Rusty questions Danny&apos;s reasons for the heist,not knowing that Danny&apos;s real aim is to take down the man who stole his wife. Danny gives Rusty a contrived and humorous speech to digress from the topic,his secret intact.With Reuben&apos;s financial backing secured,we are introduced to the rest of &quot;Ocean&apos;s 11.&quot; Blackjack dealer Frank Catton gets a transfer to one of Benedict&apos;s casinos in Las Vegas to serve as an inside man. The Malloy brothers,Turk (Scott Caan) and Virgil (Casey Affleck),are a humorous pair of car enthusiasts from Utah. In charge of the electronics is the anxious and jumpy Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison). Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) is Danny and Rusty&apos;s top choice for a demolitions man,but his other project and subsequent arrest require Rusty to rescue him from the cops,which he does by impersonating an arrogant ATF agent.In San Diego they find their &quot;grease man&quot; in Yen (Shaobo Qin),a circus acrobat. Then they guilt old-timer Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) out of retirement in St. Petersburg,Florida. Bloom&apos;s role is to sneak explosives into the vault by posing as a crooked international arms dealer who needs a safe place to stash some &quot;precious stones.&quot; With 10 people already committed,Danny goes to Chicago to recruit the young but highly skilled pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon),son of the infamous thief Bobby Caldwell. Danny is successful in wooing Linus,and &quot;Ocean&apos;s 11&quot; travels to Las Vegas to organize their scheme at Reuben&apos;s house. Linus still appears reluctant until Reuben abruptly tells him to &quot;get in the god damn house&quot; with everybody else. Every detail of the plan is laid out for the gang,with the exception of Danny&apos;s true motive. Danny believes they can grab over $150 million from Benedict&apos;s casinos on the night of a big boxing match.The team makes camp at the Bellagio and prepares to carry out the theft. They build an exact replica of the vault in a warehouse and Linus is assigned to shadowing Terry Benedict,much to his chagrin. Linus is excited to be included in the group but upset that,with all his skills,he is given little responsibility. During his surveillance of Benedict,he unknowingly reveals Danny&apos;s secret to Rusty when he shows Rusty Terry&apos;s gorgeous girlfriend,Tess.Rusty confronts Danny at the warehouse,where Danny admits that Terry and Tess are dating and his intention is to win her back. Rusty is understandably upset and threatens to abandon the project,but Danny assures him the rest of the crew is not in jeopardy of losing their fair share of the score. At this point we see that Tess and Terry&apos;s relationship is a little bit awkward and not very close.Danny confronts Tess in a restaurant and admits to her the reason he is in Las Vegas,which makes her angry. But through this hostile interaction we can see that Tess and Danny are far closer than Tess and Terry could ever be. Danny and Tess have a brief conversation before Terry shows up to join Tess for dinner,oblivious to Danny&apos;s intentions toward either his money or his girlfriend.A disgruntled Linus ignores Terry now and starts following Danny to see what he is hiding,at Rusty&apos;s request. Furthering Linus&apos; frustration,when the crew takes a detour in California,he screws up and is responsible for the team nearly getting busted. Back at the hotel,the team is worried because Danny has been &quot;red-flagged&quot; and will now be watched wherever he goes in the hotel. With his anger and embarrassment boiling over,Linus reveals to everyone that Danny is after Tess and that is the reason he was caught,and Rusty confesses to Danny that he told Linus to watch him. With Danny now unable to take a step without being seen,he is a liability and Rusty kicks him off the team. The responsibility of &quot;triggering the vault&quot; is given to Linus,a show of respect he had been dying for,but now that the task is actually conferred upon him,he is nervous. As we find out later,the whole situation was created by Rusty and Danny to give Linus the opportunity to play a key role.To get close to the vault -- and also to keep Terry distracted -- Linus poses as an agent of the Nevada Gaming Commission who comes to Terry with evidence that the Bellagio is illegally employing a convicted criminal as a dealer. The criminal turns out to be inside man Frank Catton,who drags out the interview by accusing &quot;agent&quot; Linus of racism. Terry is so eager to get back to work after this meeting that when,on the way out,Linus claims to have left something behind in the conference room,Terry leaves Linus to show himself out -- which of course he doesn&apos;t. Meanwhile,Danny,hanging around the casino floor,pisses off the thugs Terry has assigned to watch him and they drag him off to a back room to be taught a lesson. The &quot;teacher&quot; is an even bigger thug with whom Danny has arranged a trick: the thug throws himself around the room and makes a lot of noise to convince the guys guarding the door that he&apos;s beating Danny up,while Danny exits through the ductwork to surprise Linus in an elevator on the way to the vault.Fight Night has arrived and,with everything going according to plan,the team prepares to make the robbery. In their replica of the vault they recorded nothing happening. While Rusty,Saul,Turk,and Virgil distract the vault monitors in the security headquarters,Livingston taps into their computer systems so that all they see from then on is a peaceful vault with nothing happening,although it is not the real vault--just the replica.With everybody doing their part,Basher cuts power across the city by triggering a &quot;pinch&quot; -- a bomblike device that fries circuitry with a huge electromagnetic pulse. Danny and Linus break into the vault,with help from Yen waiting inside,all unseen by the video cameras. Rusty calls Terry to reveal that he is being robbed. Incredulous,Terry goes to his security center to find that nothing is happening,until the monitors switch and show the three men in the vault packing all the money into black duffel bags marked with X&apos;s. In reality,the bags are filled with fliers,not money,per the plan. (*It is to be assumed these fliers and bags were brought into the vault by the team. However,it is easy to tell that they in fact bring nothing with them into the vault. This loophole is admitted to by the director in the DVD&apos;s Special Features*).The robbers rig the &quot;money&quot; with explosives and split it into two parts. They threaten to blow up all the money unless Benedict lets them get away with half of it. Upon hearing this,Benedict calls 911 and asks for a S.W.A.T. team,but the team that responds,unbeknownst to Benedict,is the rest of Ocean&apos;s crew. (Livingston has hacked their phones and intercepts the 911 call.) Benedict complies with Rusty&apos;s demands knowing that the S.W.A.T. team is on the way. With half the &quot;money&quot; in the vault and half the &quot;money&quot; being driven away in a van,Benedict accepts his loss and focuses on catching the culprits by allowing the S.W.A.T. team to enter the vault under cover of darkness. In the dark,the crew stages a confrontation while they are actually loading the real money into bags. During this confrontation,the &quot;money&quot; explodes and Benedict thinks he has lost everything,because the van in which the other half of the money was taken away has also blown up. He comes down to the vault and talks with the S.W.A.T. team on their way out. Here he discovers that both bundles of exploding money were actually just fliers advertising prostitutes. The van was a remote-controlled decoy. He realizes that somebody made a duplicate of his vault,and that he just watched the S.W.A.T. team walk out with ALL of the money.Terry goes to confront Danny,rightly assuming that he is somehow responsible. Danny slips back into the room where he&apos;s supposedly receiving a beating just in time to meet Terry. While never admitting anything,Danny tells Terry that he can get the money back if he&apos;s willing to give up Tess,who is watching the scene on closed circuit TV in her hotel room. Terry agrees and Tess is furious. Frustrated beyond belief,Terry gives Danny to the police and he is arrested for violating his parole. Tess finds Danny before the police take him away,and she comes back to him,just as he planned. Everyone in the crew (minus Ocean),$15 million richer,watches the fountain show in front of the Bellagio to the music of Claire de Lune.Three to six months later,Tess and Danny are reunited outside of the same New Jersey prison from which Danny was released at the beginning of the movie. Rusty drives them off,everyone victorious in every aspect,with Benedict&apos;s two thugs in undercover pursuit.</Plot>

        <Plot>Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould),in an attempt to legitimize himself in his later years,is conned by his business partner and ruthless businessman Willy Bank (Al Pacino). When Bank forces Tishkoff to sign over the ownership rights of the new hotel/casino they were building together,Reuben suffers a heart attack from the revelation and becomes bed-ridden. Danny Ocean (George Clooney),after attempting to negotiate with Bank,gathers up his partners-in-crime and plans to completely ruin Bank on the night of the opening of the casino,&quot;The Bank&quot;,as a way to get revenge for Reuben.They decide to do so in two ways. First,they plan to prevent Bank&apos;s new hotel from winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award from the Royal Review board,which Bank has won four times before for other casinos. Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) poses as the reviewer of the board,while the real reviewer (David Paymer),who proclaims himself to be a Very Unimportant Person,is treated poorly during his stay through Ocean&apos;s associates and the staff of the hotel on their payroll.The second plan is to rig the casino&apos;s slot machines and other gambling games to force the hotel to pay out more than $500 million in winnings; this will force Bank to cede control of the hotel to his board. Rigging of the games would require them to defeat &quot;The Greco&quot;,a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system that monitors the games. They plan to trick Bank into carrying a cell phone with a magnetron,created by technical expert Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard),to disrupt the Greco. To assure that players cash out,Ocean&apos;s team acquires one of the giant drills used to bore the Channel Tunnel to simulate an earthquake under the hotel on its gala opening night.While the group prepares the rigged games,they run into problems when the drill fails. Ocean is forced to approach his nemesis Terry Benedict (Andy García) to fund the purchase of the second drill. While Benedict has a grudge against Bank and is willing to help,he only offers Ocean the funds if they also steal the four necklaces Bank has purchased to celebrate winning the Diamond Awards,now on display in a secured case at the top level of the hotel. Ocean plans for Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) to seduce Bank&apos;s assistant,Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin),to gain access to the display and switch the diamonds with fake ones.As Ocean&apos;s plan proceeds on opening night,agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tipped off that machines have been rigged by Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison),and have identified Livingston,which may reveal the rest of Ocean&apos;s gang to Bank. Basher (Don Cheadle) distracts Bank long enough to allow the gang to change the FBI records. Livingston is arrested by the lead agent,but is surprised to discover he is Linus&apos;s father,Bobby (Bob Einstein),in on Ocean&apos;s plan and there to help Linus swap the diamonds. As they exit to the roof of the hotel for extraction via helicopter,they are caught by François &quot;The Night Fox&quot; Toulour (Vincent Cassel),whom Benedict had ordered to intercept the diamonds. Linus hands over the diamonds to Toulour,who leaves,but discovers too late he only holds the fakes; Ocean had been aware of Toulour&apos;s presence,and arranged to extract the entire display case from the hotel with the helicopter.The remainder of Ocean&apos;s plan continues as expected,with the Greco disrupted,and guests leaving the hotel with their bountiful winnings. As Bank realizes his ruin,Ocean lets him know that they did everything for Reuben. The group uses the money they made off with to buy property north of the Las Vegas Strip for Reuben to build his own casino. As punishment for Benedict&apos;s treachery,Ocean donates his portion of the take to charity,forcing Benedict to publicly admit his philanthropy. As the group disperses on their own and considers settling down,Rusty ensures that the Very Unimportant Person is compensated by allowing him to win a $11 million jackpot at a rigged slot machine at the airport.</Plot>

        <Plot>At the beginning of Ocean&apos;s Twelve,the eleven members of Ocean&apos;s Eleven are living their lives separately off the fortunes of their Vegas casino heist in the first film. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia),the owner of the three casinos,confronts each member of the team in turn,demanding the team return his money,with interest. Benedict gives the team two weeks to come up with the money,which amounts to the original $160 million plus $38 million interest for a total of $198 million. The Ocean&apos;s Eleven members don&apos;t have enough and are short $97 million which they must get in 14 days or they are &quot;dead men&quot;.Danny and the team decide to stage another heist to pay off the debt. Being too &quot;hot&quot; to work in the United States,they pick a European target: the world&apos;s oldest stock certificate,which was issued by the Dutch East India Company in 1602,worth around 2.5 million euros,and is kept in Amsterdam. The certificate is enough to extend their deadline. The group manages to breach the security around the certificate,in part by physically lifting the building to achieve line-of-sight. But a rival thief,the &quot;Night Fox&quot; (Vincent Cassel),beats them to the document and leaves a message for them.The Night Fox is a notorious European thief who was trained by the legendary retired thief Gaspar LeMarque (Albert Finney),and believes himself to be the world&apos;s greatest thief. As it turns out,he is the one who revealed the identities of the Eleven to Benedict. The Fox is incensed that his mentor,LeMarque,failed to correct a businessman who claimed that Danny was the best thief in the world after hearing of the elaborate complexities of the Ocean&apos;s Eleven &apos;Bellagio job&apos;. The Fox breaks &quot;rule number one&quot; (revealing another thief&apos;s identity) in order to lure the team to Europe,where he can propose a challenge,since going after the same object is the only way to tell who is the best thief. Both Danny&apos;s group and the Night Fox will attempt to steal the famous Coronation Egg within a week; the first to succeed will be declared the better thief. If Danny&apos;s team wins,the Fox will pay off the team&apos;s debt to Benedict. With no other options,Danny accepts the challenge.Meanwhile,a Europol detective,Agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones),with a romantic link to Rusty,hears of the increased theft activity in Amsterdam. She forges her superior&apos;s signature on a request form in order to procure enough resources to track down the group. In the first attempt,most of the group are captured; the second,involving a very reluctant Tess (Julia Roberts) masquerading as the famous actress Julia Roberts,ends the same way,partially due to unintended interference from movie star Bruce Willis (as himself). A U.S. official,actually Linus&apos;s mother in disguise,manages their extradition.Danny and Tess meet The Night Fox at Lake Como in Italy. At his home,the Night Fox delights in explaining how he was able to steal the egg by climbing to the roof of the Museum at dark without being detected by Danny&apos;s Recon squad. He passed through the laser grid,dances his way and avoids triggering the alarm. Danny then reveals the truth: the contest was over before it began,and the egg that the Fox stole was the fake. Danny and associate Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) had previously visited LeMarque and learned the location of the real egg which was transported in a duffel bag instead of the armored car. LeMarque also warned Danny and Rusty to assume that the Night Fox would always have them under surveillance. Hearing this,the Fox is crestfallen,and Danny gets the money that the Night Fox had given to LeMarque to hold in confidence when the competition was first proposed.It is not until the end that the viewers realize that LeMarque was actually the mastermind behind the entire operation. By deliberately making the Night Fox feel inferior to Ocean&apos;s group,he manipulates the Night Fox into entering the competition. This is &quot;the solution to all our problems&quot; that he alludes to in the meeting with Daniel and Rusty. The Night Fox is the mark,and Danny&apos;s team is essentially a pawn of LeMarque. Their task is to simply acquire the egg,and then get caught. This convinces the Night Fox that he has won,although the contest is just misdirection. Another goal of LeMarque is to be reunited with his daughter,Agent Lahiri,who had thought her father had died over a decade previously.The result of the entire adventure is that Danny&apos;s group is now in the clear with Terry Benedict,the extraordinarily talented Night Fox is disgraced (both in fortune and in reputation),and LeMarque is reunited both with his daughter and with the Fabergé egg he had stolen years earlier (his wife made him put it back). This illustrates the artistry of LeMarque,and why he is regarded so highly amongst those who perform the long con. This is the reason LeMarque is so apologetic to Danny and Rusty,and he claims &quot;I&apos;m still getting the better of you&quot; at the end of their meeting. Reuben then meets with Benedict to pay him honestly and in full. During their conversation the camera zooms in on the Night Fox in the background disguised as one of Terry Benedict&apos;s gardeners,implying that the Night Fox plans to rob Terry Benedict in order to prove himself once again and to get his money back.Isabel Lahiri joins Ocean&apos;s group in a get together afterward. She and Rusty are together again.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with a time line,which states that in the future Earth has grown overpopulated and humanity has fought over the last natural resources. In the year 2174,a ship called Elysium was sent out to colonize an Earth-like planet called Tanis. In space,we see the massive ship flying towards the stars. On the bridge of the ship,we see officers receiving a message from Earth. The message is you&apos;re all that&apos;s left of us.Next,we see Bower (Ben Foster) wake up from his hyper-sleep pod. He manages to free himself from the pod and rips out the tubes going into his body. He sees that he has a series of numbers tattooed on his arm. After peeling away his dead skin,he sees that he is alone. He reads that memory loss can be a side effect of long-term hyper-sleep. Not knowing what&apos;s going on,he finds a locker with his name on it and puts on some clothes. He finds a picture of his wife. He notices a couple of other pods are nearby. A pod for Cooper is empty. Another pod still has Payton (Dennis Quad) inside. Bower tries to wake Payton up by slamming something against the sealed pod,but hardly makes a scratch on it. He tries to open the door of the room but it&apos;s locked. A power surge shakes the ship,causing Payton to wake up. Both men suffer from memory loss. Payton is a Lieutenant and Bower is a Corporal. It turns out that since the trip to Tanis would take over 100 years,the crew has been split into groups/shifts to work. At the end of a groups turn (after a couple of years),they are supposed to wake up the next group and debrief them. They realize that something&apos;s wrong since they&apos;re all alone. The numbers tattooed on their arms indicate which group they belong to. Another power surge shakes the ship,and Bower realizes that he&apos;s the engineer. Something&apos;s wrong with the reactor and he needs to fix it. Payton gets a nearby command center working by using the auxiliary power. He tries to call for help but no one answers. They hear a noise coming from a nearby vent.Payton decides that they need to find any crewmembers and get to the bridge to see what&apos;s happening. He sends Bower to find a way out in the vents while he stays behind at the command center to guide him around the ship. The vents are filled with tubes and are hard to crawl through. Bower tries to find his way to another room,but the vents look endless and run in every direction. After feeling like he&apos;s going in circles,he panics and becomes claustrophobic. Payton via radio calms Bower down by joking that he got the door open. Bower falls down a shaft and lands face-first on a grate. The fall causes him to lose contact with Payton. Bower turns on a glow stick and sees that Cooper&apos;s decomposing corpse is right next to him. He falls through the grate and ends up in a storage compartment. Bower gets up but still can&apos;t communicate with Payton. The ship&apos;s corridors are long and dark. While searching around,Bower comes across a woman trying to open a door. He tries to talk to her,but she quickly runs away. While chasing after her,he sees that she has seemingly stopped in a corridor. He tries to tell her that he&apos;s part of the crew and he needs to know what&apos;s going on. She remains silent. He shines his light on the figure and sees that it&apos;s not a woman but a man; a man who has been hung and is missing most of his lower half. The woman,Nadia (Antje Traue),pops up and attacks Bower. She holds him down and orders him to remove his shoes. Suddenly,they both hear screeching nearby.Nadia runs away while Bower is left confused. He sees a blue light at the end of the corridor and the screeching gets louder. The blue light is attached to a creature,which goes after Bower. The half-eaten man is pulled up and devoured. Bower runs back to the room he came through and hides in the storage compartment. While the creature looks for him,Payton&apos;s voice comes through the radio. The creature tears open the compartment and snatches Cooper&apos;s body. After the creature leaves,Bower tells Payton that something not human is on-board the ship. Bower then remembers his wife and that families of the crew were allowed to travel on the ship. Bower becomes desperate to find her before the creatures do. He also remembers that Payton has a wife as well. Payton tries to convince him to continue making his way to the reactor. If Bower can fix it,the power will come back on for the ship and they can implement security measures.Bower looks around and finds a security room. He finds an anti-riot gun and straps it to his arm. He goes into the corridors again and sees a hanged man. He thinks that he&apos;s going crazy since it looks like the same hanged man from before. However,upon closer inspection he finds that the man is different (he&apos;s still alive and in one piece). Bower cuts him down and is introduced to Shepard (Norman Reedus). Shepard is part of another group and has been by himself for a long time. Bower says that his commanding officer want&apos;s to know whats happening. Shepard says that there is no commanding officer and covers himself in oil to cover his scent from the creatures. He tries to leave but sees blue lights coming towards them. The creatures chase Bower and Shepard through the ship. The creatures are fast and have sharp weapons. They eventually string Shepard back up and eat him. Bower tries to shoot the creatures,but his shot is blocked by a door. The creatures see him and chase after him. He runs into Manh (Cung Le),who helps him escape from them. Bower can&apos;t understand Manh&apos;s language but still manages to communicate that he&apos;s part of the crew. He sees Manh&apos;s tattoo and sees that he&apos;s part of the agriculture crew. He tells him that he&apos;s going to start up the reactor and tells Manh to stay put. Meanwhile,Payton starts to get a bloody nose and gets increasingly scared that he can&apos;t talk to Bower.Bower finds a large cargo container that acts as a living quarters. He sees that there are several other containers as well. Bower is attacked by Nadia again,who pins him down and threatens him with a knife. Manh pops up and defends Bower. As Nadia and Manh fight,Bower fires off a shot into the air. He tells them that he understands they want to survive,but to do so they need to stay together as a team. Come to find out,Nadia speaks English and eventually agrees and the trio makes their way through the ship. Bower tells Nadia that they need to start the reactor or else they&apos;ll lose everything. Nadia says that no one has ever come back from the reactor room. However,since she knows the way,she&apos;ll lead him to it. They come across a hallway and find themselves surrounded by creatures. A power surge shakes the ship,allowing Nadia to activate a door open. They barely make it inside and seal the door. Nadia has been living in this room since she woke up. She&apos;s a biologist and says that the ship is pretty much like Noah&apos;s Ark. In addition to the 60,000 people on board,there is DNA stored for all the organisms found on Earth.After a while,Nadia leads the team through a part of the ship that holds civilian pods. Bower notices that the majority of the pods are empty. Nadia tells him that it&apos;s the creatures feeding ground and tells them to hurry. Bower wonders if his wife is there,but Nadia tells him that the families of the crew are held in another area of the ship. Bower suddenly disappears. Nadia walks over to where he was and falls down a grate. Bower lights up a glow stick and they both see that they&apos;ve fallen into a massive pit of bones and gore. The creatures appear above the grate and move through the area. Bower climbs out of the pit first but keeps Nadia at bay. While he looks around,he&apos;s attacked by a creature. Bower is thrashed around and Manh comes to defend him again. He stabs the creature in the head,but it&apos;s still alive. Nadia manages to stab it in the leg but is thrashed around as well. Bower manages to stab it in the chest,and the trio repeatedly stab it until it&apos;s dead. The other creatures come back and see them. It screeches to its mates and some jump on the defeated creature and begin to devour it while others give chase to the trio. They come into another area and witness a man wake up from his pod. Bower attempts to help him but is too late as the man is stabbed in the head and eaten by the creatures. The team takes refuge in a room and seal the door shut.Meanwhile,Payton continues to hear more and more noise coming from the vent. He grabs a pipe and climbs up. As he enters the vent,through the mass of hoses and wires,he sees a human arm reach out for him. Gallo (Cam Gigandet) is naked and covered in blood/slime and Payton pulls him through and locks the vent. Gallo says that he came from the bridge before passing out.Back to Bower and his team. They find that they are not alone. Leland (Eddie Rouse) has been living in the room for some time now. Leland is situated on a balcony above the team so that they can&apos;t reach him. He makes them some food and welcomes them to his home.Back to Payton; Gallo is passed out. Payton inspects his arm and sees that he&apos;s part of the previous group. Gallo wakes up and asks Payton what he&apos;s doing. Some of the blood on Gallo is from someone else,which makes Payton suspicious. Gallo says that he was with two other crew members,but they suffered from pandorum (i.e. space madness) and he was forced to kill them. Payton loads a needle gun with a shot to calm Gallo down,but he refuses to take it and becomes hostile. He accuses Payton of having pandorum and insists that he need the shot instead.While Nadia bandages a wound,she tells Bower that she thinks the creatures are actually mutants. In all the hyper-sleep pods,everyone was supplied with an accelerator that was supposed to help them adapt to Tanis . Instead,it could have made some people mutate and adapt to the ship.Gallo tells the story to Payton about how Earth was destroyed and the thousands of people on the ship are all that&apos;s left of humanity - Leland tells the team what happened afterward. After Elysium received the final message from Earth (you&apos;re all that&apos;s left of us) and the team (which consisted of himself and Gallo) learned of its destruction,one of the crew members suffered from pandorum. He killed his crew and then started to wake people up. He ruled over them believing himself to be God. Whenever someone disobeyed him he would banish them to a lower part of the ship. Eventually,he grew tired of this and went back to hyper-sleep. However,over time the people he banished evolved/mutated into flesh-hungry creatures and adapted to the ship. As Leland tells his story,he fills the lower room with gas,knocking everyone out.Bower wakes up to find himself,Nadia,and Manh hung upside down in the room. Leland plans on eating them for food. Nadia mouths off and Leland stabs her in the chest. He&apos;s about to fillet her when a power surge shakes the ship. Bower tells him that it was the last power surge. If they don&apos;t start the reactor within the hour,everything in the ship will shut down for good. Leland cuts them down and makes them walk through the ship at gunpoint.Meanwhile,things get heated with Gallo and Payton. Gallo thinks that they should evacuate the ship while they still can,but Payton is confident that Bower will fix the reactor. Gallo insists that Payton is starting to exhibit signs of pandorum. Payton says that Gallo is crazy and continues to order him to &quot;stand down&quot;.The team comes across the part of the ship that holds the pods for families of the crew. Bower remembers that his wife isn&apos;t on the ship. He wanted her to go with him,but she refused. She left him,which caused him to sign up to be the engineer. He sees the pod for Paytons wife and remembers her name. He also remembers something else about Payton....The team makes it to the reactor but find that below it is the sleeping ground for the creatures. Bower tries to walk across a catwalk to the reactor but it gives way. Manh holds onto the catwalk while Nadia runs across to help Bower. Seeing that Manh can&apos;t hold the weight of both of them,Bower allows himself to fall down to where the creatures are. Bower covers himself with skin/slime so that the creatures won&apos;t pick up his scent. He then crawls amongst them to get to the ladder leading up to the reactor. Once he gets there,Leland accidentally drops a light down to where the creatures are,waking them all up. Leland runs away while Manh drops the catwalk,crushing a couple of creatures. He makes noises and leads the creatures away from Bower &amp; Nadia. Bower climbs up to the reactor and turns on the power,which fries some creatures in the process.Gallo takes control of the needle gun and forces Payton to open his pod. Gallo has Payton start the ejection sequence and gets inside. However,Payton tricks Gallo and instead just locks him inside the pod.Elsewhere,Manh manages to elude the creatures but then runs into the leader. The leader tosses Manh a spear and they fight. The leader pins Manh against a wall and starts to eat his stomach. Manh grabs a knife and repeatedly stabs the leader in the head until it dies. Manh then turns around to find a creature child staring at him. He contemplates killing the child,but lowers his knife. The child in turn slices Manh&apos;s throat open. Bower turns on the reactor,providing power to the ship (which opens the door to the bridge). Payton is happy that Bower succeeded,but then finds that Gallo has escaped from his pod. Gallo attacks Payton and they fight for control over the needle gun. During the fight,their arms merge together. It&apos;s shown that Payton is the only person there and has been fighting himself. After Payton stabs himself in the leg with the needle,Leland winds up in the command center. Payton promptly fires the needle gun into Leland&apos;s eye killing him.Bower and Nadia make it back to the bridge while being chased by creatures. They lock the door and find Payton already there. Bower knew Payton&apos;s wife and knew the real Payton. It&apos;s revealed that &quot;Payton&quot; is actually Gallo! He had pandorum and was interacting with a younger version of himself (how he looked when he first started working on the ship). And Gallo is the crazed &quot;God&quot; from Leland&apos;s story. When he went back to hyper-sleep,he got into Payton&apos;s pod instead of his own. Bower asks Gallo where exactly they are. After opening the window shields,all they can see is darkness. They&apos;ve been on the ship for over 900 years. Gallo says that they can start a new society on the ship and he wants Bower to join him. Bower hallucinates about creatures trying to break into the bridge. Gallo wants him to give in to the pandorum. Then Nadia sees fish swimming past the ship. They realize that Elysium has been on Tanis the entire time. They crash-landed into an ocean and are underwater. Gallo begins to choke Bower and Nadia tries to defend him. Gallo throws her off and advances on her with a knife. Bower,still hallucinating,shoots a compartment (thinking a creature is coming through),causing a piece to crack the window. Bower grabs Nadia just in time to see the windows break,flooding the ship with water. They run off and Gallo drowns.Bower and Nadia run back to Bower&apos;s pod. They both get in and seal the door shut,but a lot of water gets in as well. Bower lets Nadia have his air mask while he almost drowns. The pod pops out of the surface of the ocean. Bower and Nadia survive and look around the alien planet. The ship,experiencing a hull breach,conducts the evacuation plan and all the remaining pods are ejected. Soon the rest of the pods pop out of the ocean and the remaining people start to wake up.The film ends with text,stating that the population on Tanis year ONE is 1,213 people.</Plot>

        <Plot>Against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes,General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) addresses his troops on the eve of battle. His uniform is impeccable,his medals uncountable,and his ramrod demeanor unassailable. As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure,his manner runs the gamut from stern,to jovial,amused,profane and reverent. To Patton,it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.North Africa,1942: In their first encounter with Rommel&apos;s Africa Corps,the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment,Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what&apos;s needed is the best tank commander they&apos;ve got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He&apos;s also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard,a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat,he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton&apos;s belief in himself is unshakable,and there&apos;s only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine,he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he&apos;s up against,and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin,the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable,and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man&apos;s character. They note he is a romantic,reads the Bible daily,swears like a stableboy,and believes in reincarnation. Rommel,when asked what he intends to do about Patton,simply replies &quot;I will attack and annihilate him.....before he does the same to me.&quot;Soon the Germans move against the American positions in Tunisia,and Patton watches in fascination from his command post in the hills nearby. Anticipating Rommel&apos;s plan,he routs the Germans,and gives the Americans their first victory,further inflating his ego. North Africa now has two prima donnas; Patton,and the equally egotistical British commander,Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates). Naturally,they come to dislike each other intensely,and as the African campaign draws to a close,plans are made for the invasion of Italy. Patton wines and dines the appropriate officals,and pitches his own plan to invade through Sicily. Montgomery has other plans,and when Monty&apos;s are adopted over his own,Patton,outraged,vows to outdo the Field Marshal at all costs.Sicily is invaded,and Montgomery&apos;s troops fight their way up the East coast against heavy German resistance. Patton is assigned the support role of guarding Montomery&apos;s flank,but soon adopts another plan and begins to push across the island,taking the long way around. First taking Palermo,then pushing East to Messina,he races Montgomery to the finish line,pushing his men to the breaking point and creating dissension among his commanders. They do not wish to sacrifice more American casualties to Patton&apos;s ego.Soon,Montgomery and the British forces march into the liberated city of Messina amid the cheering populace. Flags wave and the pipers play as they march triumphantly into the town square; Monty has done it. He&apos;s driven the Germans out of Sicily and beaten Patton to the punch. Abruptly,the pipers falter,and fall silent. Monty quickly marches to the fore to investigate,and finds Patton,his tanks and troops neatly arrayed behind him,standing there silently with an insufferable smile on his lips. He&apos;d arrived hours ago,and was waiting only to greet his old rival.As the Italian campaign continues,Patton becomes more controversial. During a routine inspection of wounded men in a field hospital,he encounters a shell-shocked soldier crying in a corner and becomes enraged with what he perceives as a display of cowardice. Slapping the soldier,he rages at him and orders him sent back to the front. This outburst gets Patton the first serious setback he&apos;s ever experienced. A rebuke from his commander and an order to apologize to all concerned quickly follow,a bitter pill indeed for the general. Forced to swallow his pride,he stands before the assembled troops and tersely gives his explanation,then turns on his heel and marches away.The war grinds on. Patton is called to England prior to D-Day,and believes he will be commanding the invasion,but finds that his big mouth and bigger ego have gotten him into too much trouble. He&apos;s become a liability to the fragile alliance Eisenhower is trying to hold together to fight the Germans,so Patton&apos;s orders are to shut up and stay out of trouble. Chafing at what may be his last chance to be in a great battle,he&apos;ll do anything to get back in the game. Arriving in France days after the invasion,he meets with General Bradley again,who puts Patton on probation and gives him a chance to redeem himself. Grateful for the opportunity,Patton quickly shows the rest of the world what he can do,chasing the Germans clear across France,and gaining more ground in less time than any other allied outfit.Christmas approaches,and the Germans mount a final major counter-attack at the Battle of the Bulge. Caught off guard,the American troops are trapped and surrounded,and only a miracle can save them. Patton vows to provide one. Marching his men north at breakneck speed,he amazingly arrives in time and relieves the trapped Americans,grabbing the limelight once more. Now it&apos;s on to Germany,and as the war winds down,Patton becomes despondent at the impending cessation of hostilities. All too soon,Patton&apos;s mouth gets him in trouble again as he first snubs the Russians,and then compares the defeated Nazis to other political parties in the U.S. Another uproar ensues,and Eisenhower is forced to relieve Patton once again.Having proved himself one of the greatest military commanders of WWII,he now faces a future and a world that no longer need him. Recalling history,he ruminates: &quot;For over a thousand years,Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot,the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children,robed in white,stood with him in the chariot,or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror,holding a golden crown,and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>Partially based on the book &quot;Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer&quot; written by Paul Feiberger and Michael Swaine,the director Martyn Burke jump cuts through key moments in time for the two companies in telling the tale of Apple&apos;s rise,Steve Jobs&apos; business relationship with Bill Gates,the schism between Jobs and Steve Wozniak,and Apple&apos;s fall as Gates out pirates the pirates,and leads Microsoft to dominate the computer industry.From the very beginning of the movie you are given the core of Steve Jobs&apos; (played by Noah Wyle) personality. The open lines are him speaking to the camera and saying,&quot;I don&apos;t want you to think of this as just a film - some process of converting electrons and magnetic impulses into shapes and figures and sounds - no. Listen to me. We&apos;re here to make a dent in the universe. Otherwise,why even be here? We&apos;re creating a completely new consciousness,like an artist or a poet. We&apos;re rewriting the history of human thought with what we&apos;re doing. That&apos;s how you have to think of this.&quot; His best friend,Steve &quot;the Woz&quot; Wozniak (played by Joey Slotnick),follows this with a narration describing how everything Steve Jobs ever did was something &quot;between a religious experience and some sort of crusade.&quot;Both the opening lines and the narration are spoken over the back drop of the filming of Apples 1984 Super Bowl commercial. A commercial that was legendary even before it was aired,and set the standard for all other Super Bowl commercials. Directed by Ridley Scott,newly famous for directing Blade Runner,this commercial introduced Apple&apos;s Macintosh computer and,though it has never run again since that Super Bowl spot,few commercials have ever been more influential. It was even named the 1980s&apos; Commercial of the Decade by Advertising Age magazine.The filming of the commercial fades to the actual ad as it opens on a gray network of futuristic tubes connecting non-descript oppressive buildings. Inside the tubes,we see the greyed-out downtrodden masses marching into an auditorium,where they bow before a Big Brother figure preaching from a giant TV screen. Then,from the back of the auditorium,one lone woman,the only object with any color,races down a hallway chased by storm troopers. She runs up to the screen,hurls a hammer and shatters the TV image. The screen explodes and everything flashes to white.The movie then transitions to a stage thirteen years later,where Steve Jobs is just announcing &quot;the business deal that will turn Apple around,&quot; to a gathered audience,and introduces the other protagonist in the movie,Bill Gates who is currently being projected,via live feed,to a screen looming over the audience,in a very Big Brother manner,a not-so-subtle portent for events in the movie.The scene cuts to the University of Berkley campus,1971,amidst a tear gas and students rioting,a young Jobs and Wozniak dash to safety. Once away from the crowd Jobs scornfully says,&quot;Those guys think they&apos;re revolutionaries. They&apos;re not revolutionaries,we are.&quot; Wozniak resumes his narration,relaying that Jobs was never like,&quot;you or me,he always saw things differently,he saw the meaning of the universe.&quot;Jobs and Woz&apos;s first entrepreneurial scheme was the development and selling of &quot;Blue Boxes&quot;,one of the earliest phone line crackers that allowed anybody to call anywhere for free. After almost getting busted Woz decided to try building something that wouldn&apos;t land them in jail,a &quot;computer&quot;. They have their first taste of fame as a reporter takes a picture of them when it catches on fire.Bill Gates&apos; (played by Anthony Michael Hall) beginnings are just as unassuming. His story starts when he is a Harvard student more interested in poker than classes. However,for Bill and his friend Paul Allen (played by Josh Hopkins),there is one thing more important than poker or even Playboys,and that is,of course,computers. In following an ad in a trade magazine with some fast talking by Bill,and their collective genius,Bill and Paul are hired to start writing a program language for the new ALTAIR computer.At the 1976 Berkley campus,Homebrew Computer Club,Jobs and Woz unveil their latest computer. It is obvious that while it is Wozniak&apos;s genius that built the computer,it was Jobs&apos; genius that sells it. During these scenes they reveal Steve Jobs&apos; near obsessive desire to wipe out &quot;the enemy&quot;,IBM. However,his dreams of guerrilla warfare victory over IBM,followed by world domination,is all but dashed by Wozniak as he divulges that because of a contract he signed with Hewlett-Packard,anything he invents,they can take. Fortunately the executives at the company do not have the vision of Steve,Woz,or even Bill as they pass on the &quot;home computer&quot; because,&quot;This gadget is for ordinary people,what on earth would ordinary people want with computers?&quot; While that was an initial victory for them,it seemed that bankers and business men had the same opinion and months went by as they were repeatedly turned down for a loan. However,Jobs was undaunted and persevered when venture capitalist Mike Markkula (played by Jeffery Nordling) offered the fledgling Apple Computers a quarter of a million dollars to do something (in Steve Jobs&apos; words) &quot;practically spiritual,about overthrowing a dead culture and dead gods.&quot;In Albuquerque,1976,Bill and Paul had quit Harvard and Bill&apos;s fast talking at the computer company MITS (maker of the ALTAIR) earned them a signing bonus and a double in royalties for their BASIC programming language,with that,Microsoft is born. It is during these years in Albuquerque,fueled by his own manic personality that Bill does everything from having a midnight race with bulldozers,to racking up so many speeding tickets that he is arrested and jailed.Stepping away from his revolutionary counterculture style,Steve Jobs shocks his friends by changing into a business suit and shaving the last of his facial hair for the 1977 Computer Fair in San Francisco. Even more shocking to all of them was that Apple Computers Inc. was the star of the Fair. Drawn by belief that &quot;there might be something going on in California,&quot; Bill Gates and Paul Allen attended the Fair,where Apple and Microsoft first meet,and,anti-climactically,Steve Jobs completely ignores Bill Gates. Jobs is too enamored with his sudden fame,and describes the experience as &quot;insanely great&quot;,words that are used to describe him and his life repeatedly.Following the Computer Fair,sales of the Apple II brought Apple Computers to levels of attention,money,expansion and success that only Jobs could have predicted. However,while Woz seemed overwhelmed by the sudden success,Jobs took to it like a shark to water. Feeling justified in his obsession,there were few lines he wouldn&apos;t cross,from verbally abuse enthusiastic employees until they are mute with humiliation,to grilling a potential employee (with his bare feet casually resting on the conference table) about when the potential employee may or may not have lost his virginity,all in service of his grand vision and ego.Steve Jobs&apos; level of self-obsession was put on display by his abject denial that girlfriend was pregnant by him,despite a positive paternity test,and dismissed her so she could go &quot;play mommy&quot;. That callous vitriol made even more striking because he himself was orphaned and spent much of his adult life trying to find his real mother. Later on he tracked down his estranged-girlfriend demanding that she not name &quot;their&quot; daughter some weird name and they settled on Lisa. Not coincidently,he later named a series of computers Lisa,but it wasn&apos;t until over a decade later that he actually accepted Lisa has his flesh and blood.Bill Gates&apos; own logic defying obsessive needs he revealed after he brought Steve Ballmer (played by John DiMaggio),an old Harvard friend,out to California. He lectured them,&quot;You know how you survive? You make people need you. You survive because you make them need what you have. And then they have nowhere else to go.&quot; Declaring to (in mafia style) &quot;keep your friends close,and your enemies closer,&quot; he takes Microsoft to go into business with IBM. He convinced the IBM executives that they needed what he had,an operating system,furthermore he told the execs that Microsoft would only license IBM the software,allowing Microsoft to retain ownership of it and could license it to other outfits. Astonishingly,Microsoft didn&apos;t even have an operating system at that time,and even more amazing,a deal the execs agreed to because &quot;the profits are in the computers themselves,not this software stuff.&quot; And while the others marveled at Bill&apos;s brazen declaration,Gates said he knew it would work because,&quot;IBM was successful,and success is a menace. It fools smart people into thinking they can&apos;t lose.&quot; Another omen for the future of Microsoft and Apple.Steve Jobs heralds in the next series of events by quoting Picasso,&quot;Good artists copy,great artists steal.&quot; Xerox research engineers had developed the next evolution in computers,not only had they designed software that could display graphics on the computer screen,they had also invented the mouse. Unfortunately,these innovations were so completely distained by short-sighted Xerox executives that they invited Steve Jobs and his research engineers to the Xerox research center and all but handed Apple the next step in computers. Incorporated in the new Apple Lisa,this earned Apple an estimated $100 billion.Now it is time for the two to meet again,Bill Gates,repeating Picasso&apos;s quote (incorrectly attributing it to Van Gogh),took his team to the Apple Headquarters,and it is here that the rival obsessions clashed. Steve Jobs maintains the superiority of Apple because Microsoft lacked originality and culture,and his people echoing his line,&quot;It is better to be a pirate,than be in the navy&quot; (better to be a rebel than to be a part of the establishment). Bill then tries to convince Steve that Apple is economically vulnerable and that &quot;Apple needed them,because Apple couldn&apos;t match Microsoft&apos;s diversity.&quot; Only for Steve to stay true to his cause saying,&quot;You can&apos;t just have employees anymore. They gotta be into a crusade. It&apos;s like art,science,religion,all rolled into one.&quot; It was only by feeding into Steve&apos;s obsessive hatred of IBM that Bill was able to get the &quot;in&quot; he needed. Microsoft walked out with Apple&apos;s Macintosh system just as Apple had walked out with Xerox&apos;s system.Further cracks in Steve Jobs&apos; management strategy caused greater rifts. To fuel internal competiveness he manipulated Apple employees into vicious &quot;Mac vs All other Apple platforms,who&apos;s was better&quot; rivalry. The strain of 90+ hour work weeks,and days of sleepless programing led to many employees rebelling against Jobs&apos; verbal abuse,even to the point of assaulting him in one scene. By then Woz had had enough. Disturbed by Jobs&apos; manipulations,he left the company he co-founded,and went on to teach computers to school children. Nevertheless,Jobs felt he was righteous and unstoppable,regardless of the pressure he put on everybody,his employees loved him for it,and he rewarded them for their loyalty.At this point Microsoft is desperately trying to cobble together the Windows operating system from pirated Macintosh software. Word of this eventually reached Jobs more than once,but no matter how angry or accusatory Steve became,Bill could always calmly explain away any such fears,weathering any of Steve&apos;s tirades meekly,placating Steve into,once again,believing that Microsoft was no threat,a level of manipulation that Steve Ballmer felt was where Bill Gates&apos; true genius lay. Then again,Ballmer felt that Jobs&apos; genius lay in making computers not a business,but a religion,and nothing scared him more.During the penultimate scene of the movie,Steve Jobs introduces an Apple T-shirt wearing Bill Gates as a part of the Apple family to an audience of Apple employees before giving them a sneak preview of the Apple 1984 commercial that was being filmed in the open scene. After the sneak preview,Steve was given concrete proof that Microsoft did replicated software from the Macintosh and when he confronted Bill with it,Gates famously replies with,&quot;You and I are both like guys who had this rich neighbor - Xerox - who left the door open all the time. And you go sneakin&apos; in to steal a TV set. Only when you get there,you realize that I got there first. I got the loot,Steve! And you&apos;re yellin&apos;? &quot;That&apos;s not fair. I wanted to try to steal it first.&quot; You&apos;re too late.&quot;The end of the movie relates the sad facts that Steve Jobs had disaffected so many of his former best friends that none of them wanted to toast him for his 30th birthday,in fact,three months later Steve Jobs was fired from the company he helped found. He was later re-hired in 1997 and became the architect of the second Apple Microsoft co-endeavor bringing the companies and the movie full circle.</Plot>

        <Plot>To increase his and the East India Trading Company&apos;s power in the Caribbean,Lord Cutler Beckett executes anyone,including women and children,suspected of or remotely associated with piracy. Beckett,who now possesses Davy Jones&apos;s heart,orders Jones to destroy all pirate ships. Condemned prisoners defiantly sing a song to summon the nine pirate lords comprising the (fourth) Brethren Court to convene at Shipwreck Cove and take action against Beckett. However,Captain Jack Sparrow,pirate lord of the Caribbean,never appointed his successor,and therefore must attend. Captain Barbossa leads Will,Elizabeth,Tia Dalma and Black Pearl crewmen to rescue Jack. Sao Feng,pirate lord of the South China Sea and residing in Singapore,possesses a map to World&apos;s End,the gateway to Davy Jones&apos; Locker,where Jack is eternally imprisoned. Elizabeth and Barbossa bargain with Feng for the map and a ship,but Feng is furious that Will already attempted to steal it. The British Royal Navy,led by Mercer,acting under orders from Beckett,make a surprise attack on Feng&apos;s bathhouse. During the ensuing chaos,Will strikes a bargain with Feng for the Black Pearl in exchange for Sparrow,who Feng wants to turn over to Beckett,presumably for immunity from Davy Jones&apos; attacks on pirates. Will wants the Black Pearl to rescue his father from The Flying Dutchman.The crew journey through a frozen sea and sail over an enormous waterfall into the Locker. Sparrow,trapped aboard the Pearl,constantly hallucinates about an entire crew comprising himself,each representing a different facet of his character. When the Pearl is mysteriously carried to an ocean shore by crab-like creatures (presumably sent by Tia Dalma,since she is seen stroking a crab as the ship moves),Jack is reunited with his old shipmates. He is initially reluctant to rejoin a crew which includes the four people who once attempted to kill him,with one (Elizabeth) succeeding. As the Black Pearl crew seek an escape route,dead souls are seen floating by underwater. Tia Dalma reveals that Davy Jones was appointed by Calypso,Goddess of the Sea and his lover,to ferry the dead to the next world. In return,Jones was allowed to step upon land for one day every ten years to be with his love; but when she failed to meet him,the scorned captain abandoned his duty and transformed into a monster. Elizabeth sees her father,Governor Weatherby Swann&apos;s soul pass by in a boat,murdered by Cutler Beckett after Swann became suspicious about the heart. Swann reveals that whoever stabs Jones&apos; heart becomes the Flying Dutchman&apos;s immortal captain. A distraught Elizabeth vows revenge.The Black Pearl remains trapped in the Locker until Sparrow deciphers a clue on the map,realizing the ship must be capsized to return to the living world. The ship is overturned at sunset and upturns back into the living world as the sun rises; a green flash marks their return. The crew stop at a small island to restock supplies,they find the carcass of the Kraken (the beast having been killed by Jones on Beckett&apos;s orders),where Jack realises just how serious the threat to piracy&apos;s existence truly is. Further in,they are ambushed by Sao Feng,who reveals his secret agreement with Will. However,he betrays Will,having made another deal with Cutler Beckett to hand over the crew and keep the Black Pearl. The Endeavor arrives,and Sparrow is taken aboard,although he refuses to divulge to Beckett where the Brethren Court will convene: instead,Jack manufactures a deal to lead Beckett to where the pirates will convene and lure them out for Beckett to destroy,in exchange for Beckett protecting him from Jones. When Feng is double-crossed by Beckett,Feng bargains with Barbossa to release the Pearl in exchange for Elizabeth,who he believes is Calypso trapped in human form. Feng attacks the Endeavor,allowing Jack to escape. Aboard his warship,the Empress,Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court trapped Calypso into human form so men could rule the seas. Davy Jones attacks Feng&apos;s ship. The mortally wounded Feng appoints Elizabeth as the new captain and the Pirate Lord of the South China Sea. She and the crew are then imprisoned in the Flying Dutchman&apos;s brig. Also aboard is Admiral James Norrington,who frees Elizabeth and her crew after regretting his prior actions. They escape to their ship,although Norrington is killed by Will&apos;s deranged father,&quot;Bootstrap&quot; Bill after discovering Norrington aiding Elizabeth and her crew&apos;s escape.Will leaves a trail of floating corpses for Beckett&apos;s ship to follow. Jack catches Will and gives him his magical compass so Beckett can find Shipwreck Cove. Jack then tosses him overboard,but Will is rescued by Beckett&apos;s ship,and it is revealed that Davy Jones masterminded Calypso&apos;s imprisonment by the first pirate lords. At Shipwreck Island,the nine pirate lords introduce themselves and present the nine pieces of eight. When they are told the reason of the meeting,they disagree over freeing Calypso. Barbossa calls upon Captain Teague Sparrow,Keeper of the Pirata Codex,and Jack&apos;s father,to confirm that only a Pirate King can declare war. Elizabeth,newly ordained Pirate Lord of the South China Sea,is elected Pirate King after Sparrows vote for her breaks a stalemate (each pirate lord only voted for themselves). She orders the pirates to go to war against Beckett. During a parley with Beckett and Jones,Elizabeth and Barbossa swap Sparrow for Will.Barbossa tricks the other pirate lords into yielding their &quot;pieces of eight&quot; rank insignias,which he needs to free Calypso,who is bound in human form as Tia Dalma. As Barbossa releases her in a ritual,Will discloses that it was Davy Jones,her lover,who betrayed her to the Brethren Court. Her fury unleashes a violent maelstrom just as the Navy&apos;s massive fleet appears on the horizon. During the battle,Sparrow escapes the Flying Dutchman&apos;s brig and steals the Dead Man&apos;s Chest. Meanwhile,Davy Jones kills Mercer and obtains the key to the chest,which Jack then steals from Jones during a duel. The Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman face off near the center of the massive maelstrom. Will proposes to Elizabeth,and Captain Barbossa marries them in the midst of battle. Will boards the Flying Dutchman to retrieve the chest,but is mortally wounded by Davy Jones. As Bootstrap Bill attacks Jones,Sparrow,who wanted the heart for his own immortality,places his broken sabre in Will&apos;s hand and helps him stab Jones&apos; heart,killing Jones. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Flying Dutchman as the crew carve out the dead Will&apos;s heart and places it into the Dead Man&apos;s Chest; the ship disappears into the whirlpool. Beckett,never intending to honor his agreement with Jack,moves to attack the Black Pearl. The Dutchman suddenly resurfaces from the depths,with Will as the captain and the crewmen now human. Will and Sparrow aim the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl at the Endeavour,destroying it and killing Beckett. The armada retreats in disarray.Although Will has been saved and the Dutchman crew has regained their humanity,he is bound to sail the sea as the Dutchman&apos;s captain. Will and Elizabeth have one day together where they consummate their marriage on an island. Will departs at sunset,but first gives Elizabeth the Dead Man&apos;s Chest for safekeeping. Shortly after,Barbossa again commandeers the Black Pearl,stranding Jack and Gibbs in Tortuga. Having anticipated Barbossa&apos;s deception,however,Sparrow has already removed the map&apos;s middle that leads to the Fountain of Youth.In a post-credits scene set ten years later,Elizabeth and her and Will&apos;s nine-year old son stand atop a seacliff; a green flash fills the sky. The Flying Dutchman appears on the horizon with Will Turner aboard,sailing towards his family. In the DVD commentary,the screenwriters state that because Elizabeth remained faithful to Will for the interim 10 years,and he fulfilled his duty to ferry souls to the next world,he is freed from the Flying Dutchman. Though the &quot;Pirates Secrets Revealed&quot; leaflet insert in the DVD release says that Will is bound forever to the Flying Dutchman and may only step on land once every ten years,this may only be a misconception on Disney&apos;s part.</Plot>

        <Plot>The wedding for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is disrupted with the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Co. who has warrants to arrest the two and the ex-Commodore James Norrington for helping Captain Jack Sparrow to evade his hanging. Elizabeth is imprisoned while Beckett negotiates with Will to locate Jack and retrieve his compass which has the ability to point in the direction of what a person most desires. At the same time,Jack Sparrow reveals to his crew on The Black Pearl that they are going to find a mysterious key. Jack is approached by a reincarnated Bootstrap Bill Turner,Will&apos;s long-deceased father,who reveals he is now part of the crew of The Flying Dutchman captained by Davy Jones,and Jack must pay his debt to him - Jack asking Jones to raise his ship from the depths and make him captain for thirteen years. Bootstrap further tells Jack that the Kraken will be sent after him. In panic,Jack sails the Black Pearl to the nearest land.Will searches for Jack,eventually finding the Black Pearl on Pelegosto where a tribe of cannibals worship Jack as a god and plan to eat him. Jack,Will and surviving crew members escape the island,joined by Pintel and Ragetti,former members of the Black Pearl crew who escaped execution. Elizabeth escapes jail with help from her father Weatherby Swann but he is captured while Elizabeth is sent off by Beckett to offer Letters of Marque to Jack in return for the compass. Jack and his crew visit voodoo priestess Tia Dalma,who tells them that the key unlocks the Dead Man&apos;s Chest where Davy Jones&apos; cut-out heart is hidden; the key is in possession of Jones. Tia also gives Jack a jar of dirt to protect him from Jones,since Jones is cursed to touch land only once every ten years.&#x0A;Upon finding a damaged ship,Jack sends Will aboard to &quot;settle&quot; his debt with Jones. Will is captured by the fish-like crewmen of the Flying Dutchman and Davy Jones reunites with Jack,forcing him to gather one-hundred souls in three days for his deal to be called off. Will is drafted onto the Dutchman,where he meets his father,Bootstrap Bill. After tricking Jones into revealing the location of the key,Will manages to steal it from Jones while he is sleeping and escapes the ship with the promise to rescue Bootstrap. Jack and his crew stop in Tortuga,where Elizabeth and a drunken Norrington join them.Jack and his first mate Joshamee Gibbs realize that Beckett wants the compass to seek the chest and use Jones&apos; heart to control him and destroy all piracy on the seas. Will finds refuge on a trading ship,but it is destroyed by the Kraken. The Black Pearl sails to Isla Cruces where the chest is buried,and Jack,Elizabeth and Norrington recover it. Will arrives with the key,planning to stab the heart to free his father,unaware that whoever stabs the heart becomes the next captain of the Flying Dutchman. Norrington wants the heart to regain his position in the Navy,while Jack is primarily interested in becoming immortal,able to sail the ocean waters for all time.&#x0A;Quickly,the argument about the heart&apos;s fate flares tempers,and a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack,Will and Norrington. While Pintel and Ragetti try to steal the chest,Jones&apos; crew arrives on the island,forcing Elizabeth,Pintel and Ragetti to fight them together,causing the chest to be dropped. Jack unlocks the chest,finds the heart inside,and hides it in the jar of dirt Tia Dalma gave him. Norrington spirits away the heart and the Letters of Marque,Jack believing the heart is still in the jar. Later,the Flying Dutchman attacks the Black Pearl which escapes the Dutchman until then attacked by the Kraken. Jack tries to flee,but returns to help defeat the Kraken,wounding it with an explosion,but the ship is heavily damaged and most of the crew are dead,leaving only Jack,Will,Elizabeth,Gibbs,Pintel,Ragetti,Cotton and Marty. Jack orders everyone to abandon ship,but Elizabeth,having realized that the Kraken is only after Jack and not the ship or crew,chains him to the mast to ensure everyone else&apos;s escape.Jack frees himself,but the Kraken rises up behind him. In a final act of defiance,Jack launches himself into the Kraken&apos;s maw,and the monster takes the Pearl down to the depths,which Jones watches from his telescope. Jones then opens the chest to find the heart missing,which is delivered to Beckett by Norrington. The surviving members of the Black Pearl return to Tia Dalma,who suggests they retrieve Jack from the afterlife,but recommends a captain who knows those waters. Then,to everyone&apos;s surprise,a resurrected Captain Barbossa arrives,asking about the fate of &quot;his&quot; ship.</Plot>

        <Plot>As Governor Weatherby Swann and his twelve-year-old daughter,Elizabeth,sail to Port Royal,Jamaica,their vessel,HMS Dauntless encounters a shipwreck with a sole survivor,the young Will Turner,floating among the wreckage. Elizabeth finds and hides a gold medallion she found around the unconscious Will&apos;s neck,fearing he would be accused of piracy. She then glimpses a ghostly pirate ship (the Black Pearl),disappearing into the mist.Eight years later Captain James Norrington of the British Royal Navy is promoted to Commodore. At his ceremony,he proposes to Elizabeth. Before she is able to answer,her over-tightened corset causes her to faint and fall off the rampart,tumbling into the bay. The medallion she is wearing emits a mysterious pulse through the water.Meanwhile,pirate Captain Jack Sparrow has arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Seeing Elizabeth fall,he rescues her,but Norrington recognizes him as the notorious pirate and he is arrested. He escapes and ducks into a blacksmith shop where he encounters Will Turner,now a blacksmith&apos;s apprentice and self-taught expert swordsman. Following a sword fight with Turner,Sparrow is knocked unconscious and jailed,set to be hanged the next day. That night,Port Royal is besieged by the Pearl,answering the medallion&apos;s mysterious call. Elizabeth is captured and invokes parley an agreement ensuring one&apos;s safety until meeting and negotiating with the opposing side. Not wishing to reveal that she&apos;s the Governor&apos;s daughter,Elizabeth tells Captain Barbossa her surname is Turner. She negotiates for the pirates to cease the attack on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. Barbossa agrees but,employing a loophole in their agreement,keeps Elizabeth prisoner,believing she is the key to breaking an ancient curse they are under.When Commodore Norrington refuses to take immediate action,Will,who loves Elizabeth,persuades Captain Jack Sparrow to help him rescue her in exchange for freeing him from jail. Jack agrees only after learning Will&apos;s last name is Turner. After commandeering the HMS Interceptor Jack and Will recruit a crew in Tortuga with help from Jack&apos;s old friend,Gibbs,a former boatswain in the Royal Navy. They set sail for Isla de Muerta,a mysterious island Jack knows the pirates will go to in order to break the curse.While on route,Will learns about Jack&apos;s past. He was once the captain of the Pearl,but when he shared the bearings to a hidden chest of Aztec gold coins,First Mate Barbossa instigated a mutiny and marooned Jack on an island. Jack escaped three days later. The pirates found and spent the treasure,but soon learned it was cursed and had turned them into near-immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are only revealed in moonlight. The curse can only be lifted when every coin and each pirate&apos;s blood is returned to the chest. William &quot;Bootstrap Bill&quot; Turner,Jack&apos;s only supporter,sent a coin to his son,Will,believing the crew should remain cursed for what they did to Jack. Barbossa had Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard,only to realize later that his blood is also needed to break the curse; a Turner relative must now take his place.In a cave full of treasure on Isla de Muerta,Barbossa,believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap&apos;s child,anoints the last coin with her blood and drops it into the chest,unsurprisingly,the curse remains unbroken.Reaching the island,Will suspects Sparrow may betray him and knocks him out. He rescues Elizabeth,and they escape to the Interceptor. Jack barters with Barbossa saying he will reveal Bootstrap&apos;s real child in exchange for the Pearl. Jack&apos;s negotiations come to naught,however,when the Pearl pursues the Interceptor,sinking her and taking the crew captive. Will reveals that he is Bootstrap Bill&apos;s son and demands that Elizabeth and the crew be freed,or he will shoot himself and fall overboard,lost forever. Barbossa agrees but craftily applies another loophole and maroons Elizabeth and Jack on a deserted island (the same island Jack was on ten years before) and throws Jack&apos;s crew into the brig. Will is taken to Isla de Muerta for the ritual. On the island,Elizabeth discovers the truth behind how Jack really got off the island. The island that Jack was imprisoned on was used as a cache by rum runners,who are long since out of business.Elizabeth burns an abandoned cache of rum to create a signal fire that is spotted by Norrington. She convinces Norrington to rescue Will by accepting his earlier marriage proposal. Returning to Isla de Muerta,Norrington sets an ambush outside the cave while Jack goes inside and persuades Barbossa to form an alliance. He tells him to delay breaking the curse until after they have taken the Dauntless and killed the crew. Jack then removes a coin from the chest,rendering himself immortal. But whatever Jack&apos;s actual intent is,his plan goes awry when Barbossa orders his crew to infiltrate the Dauntless from underwater. Elizabeth infiltrates the Pearl,frees Jack&apos;s crew and destroys the two pirates guarding it. She tries to enlist the crew&apos;s help,but they refuse and make off with the Pearl while Elizabeth heads to the island to aid Will. Elizabeth saves Will and together they destroy the three cursed pirate guards while Jack,immortal,reveals his true allegiance and battles Barbossa. Jack tosses his bloodied coin to Will,who returns the last two medallions to the chest,adding his own blood to his,breaking the curse. Jack then shoots Barbossa in the heart with the shot he had saved for ten years. No longer immortal,the wounded Barbossa falls dead. Realizing they are no longer cursed,the now-mortal pirates surrender to the navy.Back in Port Royal,Jack is about to be executed. Believing Jack deserves to live,Will rescues him. Both are quickly captured,but Elizabeth lends her support and declares her love for Will. Will is granted yet another pardon (having been previously cleared of stealing the Interceptor) and is allowed to marry Elizabeth with the blessing of Norrington and Governor Swann. Jack escapes by leaping (falling) from the fort and into the bay. His crew,who escaped with the Pearl,rescues him and makes him Captain. Norrington is impressed enough to allow him one day&apos;s head start before giving pursuit.</Plot>

        <Plot>The space transport vessel &quot;Hunter-Gratzner&quot; is carrying 40 people on board in cryo-sleep (suspended animation). Debris from a comet&apos;s tail pierces the ship,waking the crew and killing the captain. The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of a nearby planet,and docking pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) tries to control the descent,but the rear-heavy craft will not stabilize. She begins jettisoning aft sections sequentially,and navigator Greg Owens (Simon Burke) realizes she intends to jettison the passenger cabin as well,saying,&quot;I&apos;m not gonna die for them.&quot; He stops her by blocking the airlock,but in the sliding crash landing he is impaled by a metal shaft.Carolyn apologizes to Owens,whom she assumes is dead,but he screams after she uncovers him. She orders a passenger to fetch painkillers from the medical kit,but they are missing. With Owens in terrible pain,Carolyn orders everyone out of the ship,and alone attends to him as he dies.The planet is a barren and hot desert-scape lit by three suns,promising everlasting daylight. There are 11 survivors now: Carolyn Fry,dangerous convict and experienced escaper Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) in the custody of the armed William J. Johns (Cole Hauser),Abu &quot;Imam&quot; al-Walid (Keith David) and three young men he is escorting on hajj (a religious pilgrimage),antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald),stowaway teenager Jack (Rhianna Griffith),settlers John &apos;Zeke&apos; Ezekiel (John Moore) and his partner Sharon &apos;Shazza&apos; Montgomery (Claudia Black).As Johns explores the wrecked ship,Riddick attacks him and must be rechained. Riddick dislocates his shoulders and escapes the ship. Zeke buries the dead as the survivors send out a search party. They find gigantic skeletons,and Carolyn confesses to Johns her attempt to drop the passenger section.The find a small settlement,clearly abandoned by humans. Carolyn finds a model of the planet&apos;s solar system,and to their delight,a small shuttle spacecraft.Back at the ship,the nervous group thinks that Riddick has returned. Zeke shoots and kills a man,who turns out to have been just a passenger. As Zeke continues grave detail,he is dragged screaming into a tunnel,leaving blood everywhere. Shazza runs to the grave and finds Riddick there looking as well. A brief chase ends when Johns tears off Riddick&apos;s protective goggles,blinding him with the sun,and Shazza knocks him out.Carolyn questions the re-chained Riddick,who hints that he is no longer the group&apos;s biggest problem. As Carolyn looks at Riddick&apos;s peculiarly sensitive shiny eyes,the admiring Jack comes in and asks how to get eyes like that,since Riddick can see in the dark. Tethered by a safety line to the outside,Carolyn investigates deep inside the tunnel where Zeke disappeared,and finds his severed ankle and boot. As the planet&apos;s alien inhabitants threaten her,she attempts to escape. The group pulls her out,and then grabs her again as her tether pulls her back down into the hole.Johns decides to unchain Riddick to labor for survival,promising him freedom. Riddick says Johns should kill him instead. The group packs up some belongings and heads to the settlement,bringing along a power cell from the wreckage for testing the spacecraft,while Riddick hauls a sled. At the settlement Carolyn calculates they will need 5 more power cells to operate the small ship. Shazza offers to repair the solar-powered sandcat to carry the heavy cells.Jack shaves his head and dons a pair of goggles in emulation of his idol,Riddick. They determine that the settlement&apos;s former residents were geologists who left the planet. They try to rationalize the many items left behind,but Riddick states baldly that the former occupants are all dead. One of the young pilgrims enters a room and stirs up a nest of the aliens. Hearing his screams,the adults come and startle the flock of flying creatures who fly down into the coring shaft. They find and bury the boy&apos;s body. Shazza tries to apologize to Riddick for thinking he killed Zeke.Carolyn finds a coring sample dated 22 years ago. She returns to the solar system model and they realise that every 22 years there is a total eclipse of all three suns,plunging the planet into complete darkness.Johns insists to Carolyn they not fetch the power cells for the small ship until the last minute. He wants to prevent Riddick escaping by flying the ship,like he did for his last escape,killing the pilot. He intends to break his freedom deal with Riddick. Next,Riddick gets Carolyn alone and talks to her about his promised freedom,explains that Johns is a bounty hunter and not a cop,and hints about Johns&apos; drug problem.Carolyn finds Johns shooting morphine into his eyeball. He insists he never said he was a cop. She looks at his stash and is angry about Owens&apos; painful death. He shows her the wounds he received from Riddick.They see that the suns are actually going down. They ride the sandcat back to the crash site and load the power cells on it. Darkness falls suddenly,rendering the solar-powered cat useless. In the twilight they can see thousands of the aliens flying up into the sky. The passengers flee to the shelter of the ship,but Shazza and Riddick have to drop to the ground before reaching the ship due to the flying creatures. Shazza panics,and is torn in two and then carried off by the flying creatures when she tries to make a run for it. Riddick survives by laying low until the flock flies off.As they explore inside the ship,which has now become a prison for them,Riddick finds aliens inside as well. Another young pilgrim stumbles into the room,runs in fear and dies. Johns shoots an alien,and they realize that the creatures&apos; light-aversion is due to the fact that light actually burns them.Carolyn wants to return to the shuttle in the dark,while Johns would rather wait for the suns to rise again. Carolyn points out that strategy did not work for the geologists. She decides Riddick can lead them with his night vision. Bringing as much light as possible,including glow tubes connected to a central machine on a sled,they head out.Jack drops a flashlight and leaves the sled to get it,sparking an alien attack. Jack is saved,but Ogilvie panics and crawls away,breaking the entire glow tube system. They continue on and cross their own tracks,where Riddick states he needed time to think due to a canyon ahead,and states that &quot;the girl&quot; is bleeding. The group is stunned to discover that &quot;Jack&quot; is a girl masquerading as a boy to protect herself. In the subsequent argument Johns reveals Carolyn&apos;s treachery to the passengers.As they walk ahead of the group,Johns asks Riddick to kill &quot;Jack&quot; to be a bloody decoy for the rest of the group. As they begin to fight,Carolyn orders the group to leave the sled. The fight continues and then the light goes out. Johns&apos; bleeding wounds and movement draw an alien who kills him. Riddick finds the group again.He studies an alien skeleton and realizes they have a blind spot. The Imam offers to pray with Riddick,and Riddick explains that he believes in god ... and hates him. He ties the power cells together to prepare to run the gauntlet through the canyon.As they run,blue ichor drips down on them from the aliens fighting each other overhead in midair. The last boy pilgrim gets hurt,earning a bloody leg. Riddick keeps walking as if he is abandoning them,but &quot;Jack&quot; is attacked by an alien and Riddick turns back to save her,fighting it hand to hand. Suddenly it starts to rain,threatening what little light they have left. The last boy pilgrim is snatched by the aliens. Riddick finds a crevice for them to hide in,preserving their remaining light from the rain. He has Carolyn,&quot;Jack&quot; and the Imam enter,then pushes a boulder across the opening instead of entering.Jack worries aloud that Riddick is leaving them,since he has the power cells. They find glowing slugs on the cave walls,and fill their empty bottles with them to make lamps. Carolyn leaves the cave and heads for the ship,which Riddick is preparing to launch. He opens the door for her,and then tries to persuade her to get on the ship and leave with him,abandoning the Imam and &quot;Jack&quot;. She cries,saying that she can&apos;t. As she gets on the ship,an alien calls in the background,and she flashes back to visions of the passengers on the ship. She attacks Riddick and insists they go back for &quot;Jack&quot; and the Imam. He holds a knife to her neck and asks if she would die for them,and she says yes.Back at the cave,the rock moves aside and Carolyn and Riddick are there to get &quot;Jack&quot; and the Imam. They run to the settlement,with Riddick lagging behind. An alien suddenly blocks his way between the buildings,and he sways back and forth with it,staying in its blind spot. Unfortunately,as he draws away,a second alien appears behind him and he is &quot;visible&quot;. The others have hesitated at the ship,thinking him dead,but then they hear him yell. As Carolyn rushes towards the sound,Riddick drops down on the ground in front of her,bloody,wounded,gasping,but still clutching his knife. She tries to lift him to his feet,to get to the ship,but he is too big and heavy. She says &quot;I said I&apos;d die for them,not you.&quot; He is finally vertical when she is suddenly stabbed from behind by an alien,then pulled away into the air as it flies away with her. He collapses to the ground and says &quot;Not for me,&quot; then shouts it.The Imam and &quot;Jack&quot; chat as Riddick turns on switches,getting the ship ready to go,powering up the engines. Surprisingly,Riddick shuts the switches back off,prompting &quot;Jack&quot; to beg for take off as aliens are drawn to the now-dark area,menacing the ship. He explains they can&apos;t leave without saying goodnight. He powers up the ship&apos;s engines again and they take off,the bright light and the force of the engines kill aliens all around them as they exit the atmosphere. In space,&quot;Jack&quot; asks what they should tell the authorities about Riddick when they are questioned. Riddick tells her they should say he died on the planet.</Plot>

        <Plot>Winner* of 4 Academy AwardsÂ(r),including Best Picture,and based on the first-hand experience of OscarÂ(r)-winning** director Oliver Stone,Platoon is powerful,intense and starkly brutal. &quot;Harrowingly realistic and completely convincing&quot; (Leonard Maltin),it is &quot;a dark,unforgettable memorial&quot; (The Washington Post) to every soldier whose innocence was lost in the war-torn jungles of Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young,naive American who,upon his arrival in Vietnam,quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong,but also with the gnawing fear,physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers (OscarÂ(r)-nominated*** Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe) draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other,the conflict,chaos and hatred permeate Taylor,suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man&apos;s highest value life.</Plot>

        <Plot>Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his elite commando team arrive in a Latin American country,Valverde. They meet a general,Phillips,whom Dutch has worked for in the past,and with a CIA agent,Dillon (Carl Weathers),whom Dutch also knows. Dillon tells Dutch that a high-ranking &quot;cabinet minister&quot; traveling by helicopter nearby has gone missing in the jungle,presumably shot down by a rebel guerrilla group operating in the area. Dutch&apos;s team has been charged with going over the border and into rebel territory to rescue the man.Dutch&apos;s team are dropped into the jungle by helicopter and they hike toward the rebel camp. En route,they find the downed helicopter. Dutch&apos;s tracker,Billy (Sonny Landham),is able to determine that the rebels indeed took the cabinet minister away but another group of men also passed through,likely more American soldiers. Later,Billy senses something wrong nearby and finds the bodies of three men who have been flayed and hung upside-down. In a pile of entrails,another of Dutch&apos;s men,Mac (Bill Duke),finds a set of dog tags. Dutch recognizes the name on them; Jim Hopper,a Green Beret. Dutch is puzzled and looks to Dillon for information; Dillon says he knows nothing about another team.The team arrives at the rebel camp without being detected. Dutch and his team destroy the camp in an all-out assault and kill all the rebels. There are no hostages,however,Dutch finds a lone,terrified girl,Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). They take her along as a prisoner. Dutch realizes they have been set up and confronts Dillon. Dillon confirms that Dutch and his team were merely pawns to destroy the camp and its men. With no choice,the team heads to the chopper pick-up point. However,unknown to Dutch,they are being tracked by an unseen enemy that sees their body heat signatures.The team moves into a thickly forested valley where they plan to meet their extraction helicopter. Anna tries to escape the group and Hawkins (Shane Black) follows. When he catches her a distorted,human-like figure rushes out of the jungle and kills Hawkins. The woman is left behind,terrified and covered in Hawkins&apos; blood. Dutch&apos;s Spanish crew member,Pancho (Richard Chaves),asks Anna what happened; all she can say is &quot;the jungle came alive and took him.&quot; Dutch orders the others to find Hawkins&apos; body,which is hanging from a tree nearby. They do not find him and while he scans the area,the team&apos;s largest man,Blaine (Jesse Ventura),is hit twice by laser-like blasts of energy that blow out his chest. He falls dead and his friend,Mac,rushes to him. Mac sees a humanoid-like distortion that flashes green eyes. Mac opens fire with Blaine&apos;s minigun,firing thousands of rounds into the jungle. The rest of the team rushes to the spot and also open fire. After checking the area in front of them,Pancho tells Dutch that they didn&apos;t hit anything living. A close inspection of Blaine&apos;s wounds shows no signs of shrapnel or gun powder burns. When asked what he saw,a terrified Mac is unable to identify the enemy. Only Anna finds any evidence of the enemy; green-glowing fluid on a large leaf.In another part of the jungle,the distorted humanoid (Kevin Peter Hall) sits down on a tree branch. The distortion turns out to be a high-tech camouflaging device that can bend light,creating the illusion of invisibility. The enemy has been wounded in the thigh,dripping the same sort of fluid Anna had found; it is the creature&apos;s blood. It uses a bizarre first-aid kit to dress its&apos; wound. When it removes the bullet,it howls in pain,a sound heard by Anna.Dutch has the team make camp for the night. Blaine&apos;s body is wrapped in his poncho. The perimeter is wired with flares and grenades. Mac is given first watch and reminisces about his dead friend. A noise alerts him and an dark shape falls on him. He stabs it repeatedly drawing the rest of the team to him. The enemy turns out to be a wild pig. In the aftermath,Billy informs everyone that Blaine&apos;s body is gone.Dutch determines that their unseen enemy is not only killing them one by one but also methodically hunting them. The team constructs a trap from jungle vines which form a net and an elaborate system of tripwires. While they wait for their stalker to set off the trap,Anna talks of a legendary demon that had stalked her village in times of extremely hot weather. She says that men were found skinned and missing body parts. Dutch and Dillon think that the trap won&apos;t work without live bait so Dutch carefully walks out into the clearing among the tripwires. As he turns around,the trap goes off and something is tangled in the next. Laser blasts shoot from the net,hitting the trap&apos;s anchoring tree trunk,which detaches and swings into Pancho,hitting him square in the chest and severely injuring him. Dillon sees the distortion of the stalker&apos;s camouflage as it flees into the jungle. Mac instantly takes off after the creature seeking revenge over Dutch&apos;s orders for him to return. Dutch,Pancho,Billy and Anna all leave to meet the chopper,while Dillon runs after Mac.Dillon finds Mac a short distance away. Mac has found their enemy camped out in a tree stand. The two agree on a plan to approach it silently and kill it. While crawling through the underbrush,Mac notices a three-pointed laser pattern on his arm and is killed when he exposes his head to his enemy. Dillon finds him dead a few minutes later. Dillon is attacked by the stalker,who fires a laser blast that severs one of his arms. Dillon tries to defend himself but is impaled on a large double blade.Still moving toward the extraction site,the rest of the team cross a large tree trunk bridge. Billy,sensing the presence of the enemy,throws away his rifle and faces it alone,armed only with his machete. He is quickly killed. Dutch,Anna and Pancho stop,and Pancho is killed by a laser blast. Anna picks up a gun to shoot but Dutch kicks it away. Another laser blast hits Dutch&apos;s rifle,blowing it in half. Dutch yells for Anna to run to the helicopter and he crawls away. Dutch ends up sliding down a hill that drops him off a cliff into a river. Dutch swims to the other side and is resting on the muddy bank when his pursuer splashes down behind him. Dutch,weaponless and covered in mud,waits for his enemy to kill him. The enemy surfaces and turns out to be a large,humanoid alien possessing advanced weaponry. The adaptive camouflage device that concealed it from Dutch and his team appears to be malfunctioning due to exposure to water and the creature switches it off. It spots a target in the brush and tracks it with a three-beamed laser scope and shoots at it,a small rodent,with a shoulder-mounted cannon. The alien does not,however,see Dutch,whose body heat is insulated by the mud on his skin. The creature stalks off.Dutch mounts an offensive,choosing a strategic spot and sets a garroting trap with spikes. Dutch also builds a bow and several arrows with gunpowder from his spare grenades and fashions spears. He also covers himself in mud to further his advantage. Meanwhile,the creature rips the spinal column and skull from Billy&apos;s corpse,cleaning it to make a trophy. We see the skulls of several other humans among its collection.When he&apos;s ready,Dutch lights a large bonfire and sounds out a primitive yell,summoning the alien. The alien arrives and crawls over the unseen Dutch. Dutch fires one of his explosive arrows at the creature,permanently disabling its invisibility device. However,Dutch rapidly runs out of weapons. The alien captures him in a pond. After a brief examination of his human opponent,the creature removes its&apos; helmet,revealing its face. It then engages Dutch hand-to-hand,a battle where the alien has the advantage of strength over Dutch. Dutch draws the creature into the spiked trap he&apos;d set,yelling for it to come closer to kill him. The creature discovers the trap and walks around behind Dutch. As it moves in,Dutch notices it&apos;s standing directly under the trap&apos;s counterweight; Dutch kicks away the trigger and the counterweight plummets,crushing the alien. Dutch moves in to finish it off with a large rock but throws it away when he sees that the alien is already wounded fatally. Dutch asks &quot;What the hell are you?&quot; and the creature repeats the phrase. It opens a panel on its&apos; gauntlet and activates a timer,signaling Dutch to run. As he does,the creature laughs,imitating Billy. A small nuclear explosion goes off as Dutch leaps to cover.In a helicopter flying nearby,General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and Anna see the explosion. They see Dutch in an incinerated patch of rainforest. Dutch is recovered,looking physically exhausted.</Plot>

        <Plot>Opens with a Football game where the NYPD are playing. Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell)) is the main player and gets the word from the coach to do everything to keep their lead - they are up 14-10. He tells the team he believes in them all and they can do it. Ray Tierney (Edward Norton)) sits by Megan Egan (Lake Bell) and watches the game with Francis Tierney Jr (Noah Emmerich),his brother. They win and there is cheering all around,but Francis Jr. gets a call that a bunch of men from his Division (Francis is the CO) got killed,four officers down.Francis Jr. and Ray run to the scene and in a shabby apartment there are bodies everywhere. By the door,by the window,everything is a mess. An officer is taken out of the apartment on a stretcher as Jimmy runs in from the football game and looks at all the dead cops and starts getting angry and then locks himself into a bathroom,crying and breaking the mirror. He&apos;s very,very upset. Francis Sr. (Jon Voight) is at the scene as well,being some bigshot in the department (although it&apos;s not 100% clear what is role is) and makes orders all around.In the hospital,Ray and Jimmy are sitting there and the officer who was taken in,dies. You can hear the wailing of the wife. It was a friend of everyone,it appears.Ray goes into the bathroom and starts popping some prescription pills. Francis Sr. (his father) comes in and looks at his son and tells him he should apply to be on the task force to investigate the murders of the men. Ray mentions he isn&apos;t ready and his father disagrees,saying the dead man would have done it for him,why wouldn&apos;t he do it. Ray tries to demur again citing an old incident making him go into missing person&apos;s division,but his father will have none of it and in the end strongarms him into joining the task force.Cut to the alley where everything happened. Ray and a fellow task force officer look up the window and know whoever the shooter was,got shot and then ran out. They follow the blood and it stops,so the guy must have gotten into a car,but they don&apos;t know anything more. They find a cell phone in the snow. They have gotten some handouts of six prime suspects. An officer comes over and asks if anyone speaks Spanish because they have a kid who might have seen something. Ray says he speaks some and they go into a small convenience store where a man is yelling things in Spanish (note,most Spanish is not subtitled in the movie.) Ray tells him to calm down and get out of his face and gets the wife to take him to the kid.The kid is sleeping on a couch and is woken up when Ray comes in. Ray asks him some questions and they find out from the kid that the shooter was bleeding from his stomach,he looked scared and when he was shown the pictures,they found out his name is Angel Tezo (Ramon Rodriguez) When Ray asks what color the car was,they found out it was a white,four door car,a cab car,but not a yellow one.Cut to the car,it&apos;s abandoned in some green,non-industrial area. Jimmy,Kenny (Shea Whigham),Sandy (John Ortiz) and Eddie (Frank Grillo) are all checking out the car. Apparently this was a deal gone very bad. They were trying to kill Tezo and get some money,but everything went bad and Tezo got away,killed their people and took the money. And he killed the driver. They set out to find and kill Tezo because he can finger all of them and he knows they are out to kill him. They talk about drugs,payoff money and hits - obviously dirty cops. First,they torch the car and everything inside of it.Cut to Tezo getting a doctor to sew up his gut wound in some safehouse while some of his cronies count up the money. Tezo obviously has a temper and yells at the doctor a lot. When the doctor is done,they hand him some money,but Tezo&apos;s girl hands Tezo a potato and Tezo puts it on his gun and while kissing her,shoots the doctor using the potato as a silencer.Ray is sitting on his houseboat,looking at the crime scene photos and sees something strange in a photo. One of the men who was killed didn&apos;t have bootlaces or a belt on,so why were they there? He makes some calls,but doesn&apos;t come up with much.It&apos;s Christmas (the next day) and Ray goes up to a townhouse and puts his hand out to knock,but then just drops off a small gift on the porch instead. As he leaves,the door opens and it&apos;s Ray&apos;s wife. They are obviously estranged and it is revealed they are one month away from divorce. They&apos;ve apparently had a lot of difficulties and while they both care for each other,she can&apos;t go through it anymore and they part sadly.Eddie and Sandy go to a convenience store and get everyone out and pistol whip the cashier until he tells them some information (and admits he knows) about Tezo. The man is given 24 hours to get information or they&apos;ll kill him. Eddie shows how unstable he is when he puts a gun to the man&apos;s head and fires it,but it&apos;s empty. They then pop the register and take all his money as well.Francis Jr&apos;s wife Abby (Jennifer Ehle) is sitting on the bed,she has a bald head and looks very sick. She takes some pills and Francis comes out,asking her if she wants to do this party. She says she wouldn&apos;t miss it for anything. Downstairs there is a lot of cooking going on,Francis Sr. is very drunk and the kids are running around wanting to open presents. Upstairs,Francis Jr. gives Abby a ring saying he will love her forever and Abby almost starts crying. They go downstairs as Jimmy and his wife and family come in and everyone begins opening presents.At the dinner table,Francis Sr. is very drunk and starts overpraising Ray saying he was always the brains,and would soon be an investigator and his daughter,Megan had a huge heart and she became a nurse. He doesn&apos;t say much about Francis Jr or about Jimmy (son-in-law.) It becomes very strange and awkward at the table and it goes pretty quiet. Francis and Jimmy have a quiet talk in the hall about what is going on. Jimmy says he&apos;ll have it under control. Francis is very worried about what is going on and Jimmy isn&apos;t giving him any information.There was another shooting at the house where we first saw Tezo. The men look out and see cops and then there is blood splattering. Cut to Ray looking around and seeing they were all shot execution style. Tezo&apos;s girlfriend,who we saw give him the potato,is there and Ray squeezes her (they talk in Spanish) and she eventually reveals (after Ray threatens to take her kid away) Tezo was tipped off by a guy called Sandy in the police department. Ray says nothing to the detectives on the scene about the information and walks out.There is a large funeral procession for the dead officers and Francis Jr. has a large roll as the CO. After it is done,Ray catches up to him and starts grilling him on what might be going on in his Division. His brother starts to take offense and they get into a heated conversation when Ray says Tezo&apos;s girl dropped the name Sandy and he&apos;s a police officer. Tezo&apos;s phone was called by people outside,so someone knew about the bust the four men were doing. Ray asks him if there is anyone who goes by that nickname in his department. Francis Jr. looks shady and denies there is anyone. Ray and Francis Jr. part ways,with both being unhappy at each other.Francis Sr. meets Ray on the boat and asks what happened with him and his brother. Ray explains what he thinks might be going on and his father says to sit on it and see what really happens before stirring up a mess,after all you have to protect your own. Ray obviously doesn&apos;t like it,but his father orders him and Ray reluctantly agrees.Francis Jr. confronts Sandy in the police showers and kicks everyone else out. Sandy,in turn,starts crying and feeling very remorseful. He tells Francis Jr. that Jimmy has been doing drug dealing and tons of planned executions and that he wanted Tezo dead so he could start working with Casado (Rick Gonzalez). Francis is shocked when he hears his brother-in-law is doing all that. Sandy said he thought Francis knew everything,everyone knew about it. Francis Jr. tells Sandy to give up his badge and gun immediately and never to say anything or come by again or he&apos;d cut his pension too. Sandy tells Francis Jr. the force is all he has,Francis Jr. says Sandy doesn&apos;t have that anymore. End shot with Sandy crying on the shower floor.Abby is sitting and look at her children and starts crying,because she&apos;s dying and she&apos;s going to leave them. She hears the car pull up. Francis Jr. is sitting the car and is upset,not moving for a while as his wife tries to stop crying upstairs.Jimmy and his wife are playing with the kids. They&apos;re having fun. They bring the kids in and show a foozball table and a huge TV. The doorbell rings and a gangbanger looking person is at the door asking for Jimmy. Jimmy comes up and orders the guy out back. Jimmy&apos;s wife is very nervous about what is going on.The man is Casado and he&apos;s upset with Jimmy not keeping up his part of the deal to kill Tezo. He asks if Jimmy is slipping and Jimmy ends up pinning him to a wall,saying he&apos;s going to take care of it and threatens Casado if he ever comes near his place or family again.Jimmy calls his crew and they find out Tezo&apos;s right hand man is in town and they bust down the door and break up their dinner. They throw the man to the floor and beat him,but he won&apos;t say where Tezo is. Finally,they push his wife down and take his infant,holding it against the ironing board. Jimmy tells Kenny to call in a child services call for baby with a disfigured face. He takes the hot iron and starts to move it closer to the child&apos;s face. The mother screams for the man to tell him what the police want to know. Eventually,he reveals where Tezo is and Jimmy leaves,giving the baby back to the mother,unharmed.Ray tracks down one of his old CIs,a junkie,and after taking his stash and destroying some of it,his stoolie tells him where Tezo is.Ray calls in the location and tells the task force to get there. When he arrives outside the building,he starts scoping it out,but hears some gunshots. He calls for backup and starts going up the stairs,scared tenants are pointing him upwards. Finally he gets to the floor and sees a dead body and hears some screaming and yelling. Ray looks to find Tezo in a bathtub with Jimmy standing over him,shoving a nightstick down his throat. Ray yells at all of them and pulls the nightstick out of the man&apos;s throat and says he&apos;s still alive and to get help. Jimmy pulls Ray&apos;s gun out of Ray&apos;s holster and shoots Tezo three times in the chest. He hands the gun back and says Ray will say he was first on scene and shot the bastard who killed four cops. Ray asks if he&apos;s insane,and Jimmy pushes him against a wall and says they&apos;re all cops,so just go with the story.Ray and Francis Jr. are outside of Ray&apos;s boathouse and Ray is very upset,telling Francis what happened and asking him why Francis lied about knowing Sandy. Francis asks what Ray is going to do and Ray doesn&apos;t say much,wanting to get the blood off him and walks to the boathouse.Francis Jr. is pouring a bath for his wife and Abby can tell he&apos;s upset. She asks him what&apos;s going on and he&apos;s silent. She begs him not to start with this now. Francis Jr. says he&apos;s in really deep and doesn&apos;t know what to do and he&apos;s scared. Abby looks shocked (and very sick) and asks if there is any way to make it right. Francis Jr. says no way. It won&apos;t bring everything he&apos;s worked for crumbling down. Abby replies she knows he&apos;s a good man and she trusts him and trusts him with her children. She wants him to continue to be a good man for them. Francis Jr. replies he has Abby&apos;s back.Cut to a large office,a newspaper room. There are all sorts of theories going around and the fact Tezo&apos;s mouth was busted in and apparently there were splinters in his throat is circulating. This is big news. A call comes in for a reporter and he takes it,a man wants to meet. They meet in the rain and cold in a parking lot and the person who called in was a very disheveled looking Sandy. The reporter hides a tape recorder under his seat and tells Sandy no recording devices are around when Sandy gets into the back seat of his car. Sandy doesn&apos;t mention names but says &apos;everyone&apos; is on it. They sold their shields to the highest bidder. They killed people,dealt drugs and took payouts. He wanted to be a good cop,to protect and serve and to have pride in his job and in the blue uniform. But it all turned bad. The reporter tries to tell Sandy he can make a story out of this,get the truth out,but Sandy puts a white cloth over his head and shoots himself,splattering blood on the rear windshield.Press conference and the police are pinning the &apos;vigilante&apos; problem on the four officers already dead and Sandy. Francis Jr. is confronted by Francis Sr. who asks his son how much he knew. Francis Jr. replies he knew enough. His father expresses huge distaste and starts chiding his son when Francis Jr. breaks in that his father must have had a time where push came to shove. His father replies he never took a payout and his son looks shocked saying he never,ever took money either. He then leaves,saying he has things to do,leaving his father looking distraught.Ray picks up some street vendor food and wanders around some less than reputable part of NYC. A person is tailing him. Ray walks a bit more and then confronts the tail. It&apos;s the reporter. The reporter says he knows what happened and implies Ray is a pretty good cop. However,he knew Ray lied in a case a few years back to protect other cops (this is what is being referred to at the beginning when Ray had a small breakdown.) He tells Ray he just wants the truth to come out about the people in his older brother&apos;s division,not bring Ray down. Ray leaves,very angry and upset.In a bar,Francis Jr comes in looking for Jimmy and they go into the men&apos;s room. Francis Jr. asks Jimmy what the hell is going on and Jimmy says he&apos;s doing what Francis Jr told him to. The collars are up,the crime is down. Francis Jr. says he knows that,and he never minded if Jimmy had to pad his income a little,but this was totally out of hand. He also says if Jimmy thinks Ray is going to just turn over and lie to the IAB (Internal Affairs Bureau) he&apos;s wrong. Ray wouldn&apos;t do something like that. Jimmy tries to give Francis Jr. a bunch of money saying it was &apos;his part of all the takes&apos;,but Francis Jr. just stares at the money and then leaves. Jimmy sees things crumbling and looks distraught.Ray gets woken up in his boathouse with a call saying he needs to give his statement to the IAB. Ray doesn&apos;t want to,he thought he had more time,but he goes in. There are tons of reporters outside as well as protesters who learned Tezo was brutalized,teeth were found in his stomach and a lot of other nasty things. Ray and the IAB all shake hands,the men obviously respect him a lot. When asked what happened,Ray pauses for a long time and tells them this isn&apos;t going to go how they want it to. He says he was not the one who shot Tezo,but won&apos;t say who it was who shot him. He then respectfully declines (over and over) to make any further statement. It&apos;s the only way he can be true to himself and to the department.Francis Sr. is seeing video of Jimmy saying Ray killed Tezo and is lying. Another high up person in the department is saying all these other officers are willing to testify that is exactly how it happened. Ray is being set up and Francis Sr. says his son wouldn&apos;t ever have killed anyone like that. He walks out of the office where he&apos;s watching the videos.Ray and Francis Sr. have a fight about what Ray should do now. It vacillates a lot,but Francis Sr. just wants the department not to take a fall. Ray is still burnt up about the lie he was told to tell by his father to save the department years ago and refuses to do it again. He can&apos;t. Francis Sr&apos;s wife even comes in,but is driven out with yells from her husband. Francis Sr. is on his way to ordering Ray to lie about what happened and follow Jimmy&apos;s original story when Francis Jr. comes in and tells his father to stop. He is going to tell everything he knows about the corruption in his division (which he started) and will work with Ray to clear everything up. First,they are going to find Jimmy. Jimmy is in a bar called Irish Eyes and Francis Jr and Ray head there.Kenny and Eddie are in a car driving. Eddie says he needs some money,but Kenny says they need to lay low,citing Jimmy told them to. Eddie says that doesn&apos;t pay his rent and goes into the convenience store and tries to rob it again. He gets shot. People start looking around and some gangbangers start noticing the ruckus. Kenny runs in and sees a man holding something and shoots him,but it&apos;s just a cell phone. Kenny starts to panic,knowing he has a serious problem now. Some of the gang members who are very upset about the police murders which have been hitting the press,start to smash up the car and throw things at the store. Kenny locks the store and tries to get out,but the police at the back exit too. He holes up and uses the owner as a hostage.Francis Jr. gets the call about Kenny and Ray says he&apos;ll take care of Jimmy and Francis Jr. needs to take care of the Kenny / hostage situation. Kenny is frantically calling Jimmy,asking how to get out of the mess. It&apos;s implied Jimmy isn&apos;t answering his phone. Francis Jr. goes up to the door and talks Kenny down and gets him to open up the door,saying he just wants to help.Francis Sr. gets a call from an officer who is looking for Ray to arrest him. Francis Sr. says (honestly) Ray isn&apos;t there even though his car is outside. The detective/officer asks to come in,Francis Sr. refuses.Jimmy is sitting at the bar,looking at pictures of his wife and kids,drinking and depressed. Ray comes in,flashes his badge and orders everyone out. Ray says they are going to make things right,holding a gun on Jimmy and tells him to put his gun on the bar. They both put their gun,badges and cuffs on the bar and prepare to duke it out,with whoever wins,taking the other one in. They fight,knocking down tables and chairs and flinging each other onto the bar,scattering Jimmy&apos;s photos of his family. Finally,they land on a pool table and things are looking rough for Ray until he grabs the cue ball and beans Jimmy twice with it. Jimmy falls to the ground,dazed and Ray falls with him,hurt,but better off.Francis Jr has talked Kenny down and gets him out of the store and into a car and away. Meanwhile the whole neighbourhood is up in arms because of the police problems. One of the ringleaders who is getting everyone riled up is Tezo&apos;s right hand man who almost got his kid burnt up by Jimmy. When they see Kenny get taken away,the crowd starts to disperse,but is still pretty angry.Ray has Jimmy in cuffs and is taking him to where the standoff was happening (just a few blocks away) when the crowd starts coming towards him. They want Jimmy. The Tezo right hand man REALLY wants him. They pull Jimmy away from Ray and hold Ray,not having a beef with him. Jimmy looks towards Ray and tells him to tell his wife he loves her. They have armed Jimmy with a baseball bat and the other man has a crowbar. Jimmy realizes it is the end and drops the baseball bat. The man lams him over the head with the crowbar and Ray is screaming and struggling and they punch him one to shut him up and then all beat Jimmy into a pulp.Ray staggers to the hostage scene which is winding down. Francis Jr.,while talking to a superior,sees him and walks away to tend to his brother. Music plays over the words,but it is obvious Ray is telling his brother what happened with Jimmy. They get into a car and drive off.Ray,Francis Jr and Francis Sr are all in full dress uniform in a car,pulling up to a courthouse. There are reporters everywhere. They all look at each other and get out of the car together,all three going up the stairs,into the courthouse and in the reflection of the revolving door the final shots are of them shaking the hands of the prosecutors/investigator/bigwigs and then presumably going in to testify.</Plot>

        <Plot>Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a prominent,cynical defense attorney in Chicago whom loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-paying clients off crimes they commit on legal technicalties. One day,Vail sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton),a young,stuttering,simpleton altar boy accused of murdering the beloved and hightly respected Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson) of the Catholic Church in Chicago. As a result,Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro-bono.At first,the spotlight-loving Vail is interested primarily in the publicity that the case will bring,yet during his meetings at the county jail with Aaron,Vail comes to believe that his client is truly innocent,much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail&apos;s former lover),Janet Venable (Laura Linney).As the murder trial begins,Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders,including the corrupt District Attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney) as well as the mayor and even the regional governor,have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail also learns through the grapevine that the archbishop had been sexually abusing altar boys,including Stampler.Introducing this evidence,while it would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury,would also give his client a motive for murder,something the prosecution otherwise has lacked.The trial does not proceed well for the defense,as there is considerable evidence against Stampler since he was found running from the crime scene of the Archbishop&apos;s apartment with blood splattered all over his clothes,and he claims not to remember anything about the murder. However,public opinion holds Stampler almost certainly guilty and there are denials by the public about the Archbishop&apos;s true nature.After Vail sneaks into the Archbishop&apos;s apartment to look for more evidence,he finds a pornographic videotape of Aaron Stampler with another alter boy and a teenage girl,named Linda,performing in sexual acts while the Archbishop is filming everything. Vail annymously sends a copy of it to Janet knowing that she will introduce it as evidence,against the advice of D.A. John Shaughnessy who wants to keep his dirty dealings with Archbishop Rushman supressed at any cost.When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied,Aaron breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent,foul-mouthed sociopath who calls himself &quot;Roy.&quot; He confesses to the murder of the Archbishop for the years of molestation and abuse. &quot;Roy&quot; then throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell,injuring him. When this incident is over,Aaron Stampler reemerges and appears to have no recollection of it. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand),the psychiatrist examining Aaron,is convinced he suffers from multiple personality disorder due to childhood abuse by his own father,in which resurfaced following the molestation of the Archbishop upon him. However,Vail realizes that he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial.As a result,Vail begins to sets up a confrontation in court by dropping hints about the Archbishop&apos;s true nature as well as Aaron&apos;s multipersonality disorder. While searching for Linda,the young teen girl in the video,Vail finds her decomposing dead body in a vacant lot,but there is no clues or evidence to link Aaron to her murder.At the climax,Vail puts Aaron on the witness stand where he gently probes him in direct examination over his unhappy childhood and troubled dealings with the Archbishop. During cross-exmination,after Janet Venable questions him harshly,Aaron turns into Roy in open court and charges at her,threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. Aaron is subdued by courthouse marshals and is rushed back to his holding cell.In light of Aaron&apos;s apparent insanity,the judge (Alfre Woodard) dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Aaron not guilty by reason of mental insanity,and remands him to a maximum security mental hospital. Yet afterwords,Janet is fired from her job by her boss for allowing the corrupt dealings of the Archbishop to be made public as well as the sexual abuse of alter boys that both the Catholic Church and the city council have been trying to keep under wraps.In the final scene,Vail visits Aaron in his cell to tell him this news. Aaron says he recalls nothing of what happened in the courtroom,having again &quot;lost time.&quot; However,just as Vail is leaving,Aaron asks him to: &quot;tell Miss Venable I hope her neck is okay,&quot; which is not something that Aaron should have been able to remember if he had &quot;lost time.&quot; Due to this slip,Vail points this out,whereupon Aaron Stampler grins slyly and reveals that he has been pretending to be insane the whole time. No longer stuttering or speaking in a Southern accent,the murderous but perfectly sane Aaron admits that he didn&apos;t make up the identity of Roy... he made up the character of Aaron. Aaron Stampler now admits to having murdered Archbishop Rushman,as well as his girlfriend,Linda,whom the cleric also had molested. Aware that he would not get away with killing the Archbishop,Aaron made up his simpleton personality to gain sympathy from his lawyer as well as the judge and jury,and when his scheme become compromised,he made up the name of &apos;Roy&apos; (his real dominante and sociopath personality) to make it appear that he commited the murder under a split personality (which Aaron really doesn&apos;t have). Stunned and disillusioned at how he was so easily fooled by his own client,Vail walks away,with Aaron/Roy taunting him from the cell. Vail leaves the courthouse through the back door and takes a taxi away,now more angry and frustrated then ever,but ashamed to be in the public light anymore.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens in 1933 as John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought to the Indiana State Prison by his partner John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton (Jason Clarke),under the disguise of a prisoner drop. Dillinger and Hamilton overpower several guards and free members of their gang including Charles Makley (Christian Stolte) and Harry Pierpont (David Wenham). The jailbreak goes off without a hitch,until gang member Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau) beats a guard to death. A shootout ensues as the gang makes its getaway. Dillinger&apos;s friend and mentor Walter Dietrich (James Russo) is killed,and a furious Dillinger kicks Shouse out of the car. The rest of the gang retreats to a farm house hideout,where crooked Chicago cop Martin Zarkovich (John Michael Bolger) convinces them to hide out in Chicago,where they can be sheltered by the Mafia.In East Liverpool,Ohio,Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and several other FBI agents are running down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). Purvis kills Floyd and is promoted by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup),who is struggling to expand his Bureau into a national police agency,to lead the hunt for John Dillinger,declaring the first national &quot;War on Crime.&quot;In between a series of bank robberies,Dillinger meets Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard),his love interest,at a restaurant,and proceeds to woo her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he tells her who he is,and the two quickly become inseperable.Melvin Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying. An agent is shot and killed by the occupant. After the man escapes,Purvis realizes the killer wasn&apos;t Dillinger but Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham). After this incident,Purvis demands that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive,including Texas &quot;cowboy&quot; Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang).Police finally find Dillinger and arrest him and his gang in Tucson. Dillinger is extradited back to Indiana where he is locked up pending trial. Dillinger and a few inmates escape. Dillinger is unable to see Frechette,who is under tight surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti&apos;s (Bill Camp) Chicago Outfit associates are now unwilling to help him; Dillinger&apos;s crimes are motivating the U.S. government to begin prosecuting interstate crime,which imperils Nitti&apos;s lucrative bookmaking racket.Later,Dillinger meets fellow bank robber Tommy Carroll (Spencer Garrett) in a movie theater; with him is Ed Shouse,who wants to rejoin the gang. Carroll goads Dillinger into a bank robbery job in Sioux Falls,promising a huge score. Even though Baby Face Nelson is involved,whom he doesn&apos;t like,Dillinger agrees. A shootout (triggered by Nelson shooting a cop outside the bank) occurs in which Dillinger is shot in the arm,and Carroll is shot and left for dead. They retreat to Nelson&apos;s wilderness lodge hideout at Little Bohemia,where Dillinger&apos;s wounds are treated; the gang is disappointed to find that their haul is only a fraction of what they expected. Dillinger expresses hope he can free the rest of his gang still in prison,including Pierpont and Makley,but Red convinces him this is unlikely to happen.Purvis and his men apprehend Carroll (who is still alive) and torture him to find the rest of the gang&apos;s location. They arrive at Little Bohemia and Purvis organizes another failed ambush,in which several civilians are killed in the cross-fire. Dillinger and Red escape separately from Nelson and the rest of the gang. Agents Winstead and Hurt (Don Frye) pursue Dillinger and Hamilton through the woods on foot,engaging them in a running gun battle in which Red is shot and fatally wounded. Trying to escape along the road,Nelson,Shouse and Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff) hijack an FBI car,killing several agents in the process,including Purvis&apos;s partner Carter Baum (Rory Cochrane). After a car chase,Purvis and his men kill Nelson and the rest of the gang. Further down the road,Dillinger and Hamilton steal a farmer&apos;s car and make good their escape; Hamilton dies later that night and Dillinger buries his body,covering it in lye.Dillinger manages to meet Frechette,telling her he plans to do one last job that will pay enough for them to escape together. However,Dillinger drops her off at a hotel he thinks is safe and helplessly watches as she is captured. An interrogator,Agent Reinecke (Adam Mucci) viciously beats Frechette to learn Dillinger&apos;s whereabouts,but she refuses to talk; Purvis and Winstead arrive and angrily break up the interrogation. Meanwhile,Dillinger is meeting with Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi),who tries to recruit a disinterested Dillinger in a train robbery with his associates,the Barker Gang. Dillinger receives a note from Billie through his lawyer,Louis Piquet (Peter Gerety),telling him not to try and break her out of jail.Through crooked cop Zarkovich,Purvis enlists the help of madam and Dillinger acquaintance Anna Sage (Branka Katic),threatening her with deportation if she is not cooperative. She agrees to set up Dillinger,who is hiding with Sage.That night Dillinger and Sage see a Clark Gable movie called Manhattan Melodrama at the Biograph Theater. When the movie is over,Dillinger and the women leave as Purvis moves in. Dillinger spots the police and is shot several times before he can draw his gun. Agent Winstead,who fired the fatal shot,listens to Dillinger&apos;s last words.Later,Winstead meets Frechette in prison. He tells her that Dillinger&apos;s dying words were &quot;Tell Billie for me,&apos;Bye bye Blackbird.&apos;&quot; The closing text reveals that Melvin Purvis quit the FBI shortly afterwards and died by his own hand in 1960,and that Billie lived out of the rest of her life in Wisconsin following her release in 1936.</Plot>

        <Plot>Late one morning in the Hawthorne Grill,a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles,a couple of young Brits called Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) discuss the pros and cons of robbing banks versus liquor stores. Then they add restaurants to the equation,realizing they can make more by taking customers&apos; wallets than they get out of the till. They stand up in their booth and announce that they&apos;re robbing the diner.Earlier in the day,Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) arrive at a San Fernando Valley apartment building. They are hit men in the employ of Marsellus Wallace and have come to retrieve a valuable belonging of Wallace&apos;s from a group of would-be crooks led by a young and naive guy named Brett (Frank Whaley). They take back the valuable item -- kept in a briefcase,it glows warmly and transfixes whoever looks at it. Jules recites what he claims is a Bible verse,Ezekiel 25:17,before he and Vincent execute Brett and his men.Story #1: VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE&apos;S WIFEAt his strip club,Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw his next fight. Jules and Vincent arrive; though it&apos;s only a few hours after their visit to the Valley,the two hit men are sporting gym clothes in place of the suits they wore earlier in the day. While Jules heads to the men&apos;s room,Vincent goes to the bar and encounters Butch. The men take an instant dislike to each other. Vincent insults Butch but before Butch can retaliate,Marsellus calls Vincent over and embraces him. Marsellus is leaving town that evening and Vincent is to take Marsellus&apos;s wife,Mia (Uma Thurman),out for dinner to keep her entertained. Rumors abound that Marsellus gravely wounded another associate who he believed had been improperly friendly with Mia,so Vincent is nervous. Before picking Mia up,he visits his drug dealer,Lance (Eric Stoltz),and buys some high-quality heroin. Properly sedated,he escorts the cocaine-addicted,chain-smoking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim&apos;s,a West Hollywood 1950s theme restaurant. After some small talk about European travel,Mia&apos;s failed acting career,and foot massage,Mia enters herself and Vincent in a dance contest. They dance the twist and win an award. After dinner,they return to the Wallaces&apos; home. Vincent goes to the bathroom to talk himself out of making a pass at Mia. Meanwhile,she discovers the baggie of heroin in his coat pocket and,assuming it&apos;s cocaine,snorts some. She immediately passes out and begins to foam at the mouth. Panicked,Vincent takes the dying Mia to Lance&apos;s where they argue about what to do with her. Following Lance&apos;s advice,Vincent is able to revive her with a shot of adrenaline administered straight to the heart. Vincent takes Mia home. They agree not to tell Marsellus what happened since both of them would get in trouble for it.Story #2: THE GOLD WATCHThe following night,before his fight,Butch dreams of an incident from his childhood: Back at his Tennessee home in 1973,Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) visited Butch to bring him a gold watch. The watch had belonged to Butch&apos;s great-grandfather,who took it to World War I with him. Butch&apos;s grandfather had taken it to World War II,and Butch&apos;s father to Vietnam. Butch&apos;s father died as a POW,but gave the watch to Koons to return to Butch. Koons says that he and Butch&apos;s father had to hide the watch in their rectums to keep it away from their captors.Butch wakes from the dream. Instead of throwing the match (not shown on-screen),he fights so viciously that he kills his opponent. He took Marsellus&apos; money and bet it on himself; his winnings will amount to a small fortune. Butch makes small talk with Esmarelda (Angela Jones),the driver of the cab he is in,who reveals that she knows he&apos;s the boxer who killed his opponent; she seems fascinated with the topic of death. Esmarelda drives Butch to the seedy motel where he and his French girlfriend,Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros),are staying,having abandoned their apartment. In the morning they will travel to Butch&apos;s hometown of Knoxville,Tennessee,claim their winnings,and leave the country. While packing the next morning,however,Fabienne reveals that she forgot the gold watch,the belonging Butch cherishes above all others. After a savage outburst in which he wrecks the motel room,Butch takes Fabienne&apos;s car to get the watch,parking a few blocks away and walking across a field to his apartment as a precaution. He enters without incident and finds his wristwatch in the bedroom. He realizes he&apos;s not alone in the apartment when he notices a gun in the kitchen. Catching Vincent off guard as he emerges from the bathroom,Butch kills him with his own gun.Leaving the apartment with his watch,Butch encounters Marsellus crossing the street. He tries to run Marsellus over with his car but only wounds him and is hit by another car himself. Marsellus chases Butch into a pawn shop. There,the owner Maynard (Duane Whitaker) overpowers them. Marsellus and Butch wake up in the basement of the pawn shop,bound and gagged. Maynard has called his cousin Zed (Peter Greene),who works as a security guard. Maynard and Zed are apparently a pair of redneck serial killers who kill passersby who happen into their store. While the Gimp (Stephen Hibbert),a huge manchild dressed head to toe in black leather fetish gear,watches Butch,Maynard and Zed take Marsellus into the next room and begin to rape him. Butch escapes and knocks out the Gimp. Rather than leave the pawn shop,he procures a samurai sword and rescues Marsellus; in the process,Maynard is killed and Zed emasculated by a shotgun blast. Marsellus stays behind to oversee the torture-execution of Zed (&quot;I&apos;ma get medieval on your ass,&quot; he tells him),but promises that as long as Butch never mentions what happened and never returns to Los Angeles,Marsellus will forget that Butch betrayed him in the boxing ring. Butch agrees. In the final scene,Butch and Fabienne leave town on Zed&apos;s chopper-style motorcycle.Story #3: THE BONNIE SITUATIONThree days earlier,flashing back in time to just after Vincent and Jules finish killing Brett for stealing Marsellus&apos; prized possession,a gang member they had not known about bursts out of the bathroom and empties his gun point blank at them. However,all of the bullets miss Vincent and Jules,hitting the wall behind them,so they kill the gang member. Jules is certain this is a miracle but Vincent dismisses the idea. They leave with Marvin (Phil LaMarr),Marsellus&apos; inside man in the gang. In the car,Vincent asks Marvin if he believes in miracles,but accidentally shoots him in the head and kills him. The inside of the car is now covered in blood and brain matter. Jules drives to the house of his only friend in the Valley,a former colleague named Jimmie (Quentin Tarantino). Jimmie lets them hide the car but angrily tells them that they have to get rid of the body within an hour -- before his wife Bonnie comes home from her night shift at a hospital. Jules calls Marsellus at his home to explain their predicament. Marsellus then calls Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel),a suave and professional criminal and gambler who solves problems. Wolf arrives at Jimmie&apos;s house and tells Vincent and Jules how to clean up the car and themselves -- they have to strip out of their business suits and wear Jimmie&apos;s spare T-shirts and shorts (which explains their appearance at the strip club) -- then helps them dispose of the car and body at a junkyard belonging to a discreet friend named Monster Joe,whose daughter is Mr. Wolf&apos;s girlfriend.With the whole situation resolved,Jules and Vincent decide to have breakfast at the Hawthorne Grill,where they continue their discussion about miracles. Jules reveals his plan to leave his criminal life and travel the globe as a mendicant,helping those suffering under tyranny. Vincent mocks him,then goes to the bathroom. Just then Honey Bunny and Pumpkin (from the prologue) begin their robbery of the diner. They collect the cash from the register and the patrons&apos; wallets. Jules gives Pumpkin his wallet,but when Pumpkin tries to take Marsellus&apos; briefcase,Jules pulls his gun and disarms Pumpkin. While Vincent holds Honey Bunny at bay,Jules explains to Pumpkin how,even earlier that morning,he would have killed Pumpkin and Honey Bunny without a second thought. He recites his ersatz version of Ezekiel 25:17 again: &quot;The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,for he is truly his brother&apos;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.&quot;Jules explains that while he previously thought it was cool to make such a cold-blooded passage the last thing his victims heard,he now realizes that the &quot;tyranny of evil men&quot; part of the passage refers to him,and he intends to become a better person. He and Vincent allow Honey Bunny and Pumpkin to leave with all the money but not the briefcase. They leave the diner themselves and head to Marsellus&apos; strip club.</Plot>

De Niro gives the performance of his career as Jake La Motta, a boxer whose psychological and sexual complexities erupt into violence both in and out of the ring. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are unforgettable as the brother who falls prey to Jake&apos;s mounting paranoia and jealousy, and the fifteen-year-old girl who becomes his most prized trophy. A &quot;brilliantly photographed film of extraordinary power and rare distinction&quot; (The Wall Street Journal), Raging Bullis filmmaking at its riveting best. *1980: Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Pesci), Supporting Actress (Moriarty), Cinematography, Sound, Editing (won)</Plot>

        <Plot>In his Baltimore townhouse,famous local psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter hosts a dinner party. The main subject of conversation over dinner is the disappearance of a local musician who was criticized for playing several wrong notes at a concert that Lecter attended. He then serves the guests a delicious meal. When asked what the meat was that he served he says &apos;If I tell you,I&apos;m afraid you won&apos;t even try it.&apos;&#x0A;After dinner,Lecter is visited by Will Graham,a young gifted FBI agent,with whom he has been working on a psychological profile of a local serial killer. Edible body parts of the victims,such as the kidneys and liver were removed from the bodies after being killed,and Graham is convinced that the killer is actually a cannibal. During the consultation and brainstorming session,Graham discovers evidence implicating Dr. Lecter in the murders,shortly before Lecter returns and attacks Graham,wounding and nearly killing him before Graham resists and subdues him.Lecter is subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in an institution for the criminally insane while Graham,severely traumatized by the experience,retires from the FBI.&#x0A;Years later,another serial killer appears. Nicknamed the Tooth Fairy,he stalks and murders seemingly random families during sequential full moons. Hoping to speed things up and capture the killer before his next attack,Special Agent Jack Crawford seeks out Graham and pleads for his assistance. Graham,believing the death of another family to be an unbearable burden on his conscience,reluctantly agrees. After checking over the crime scenes,with only minimal insight,he comes to the realization that most of his previous successes were achieved due to the insightful collaborations of Dr. Lecter,and concludes that he must once again visit Lecter and seek his help in capturing the Tooth Fairy.The Tooth Fairy is actually a disturbed man named Francis Dolarhyde who suffers from schizophrenia and worships Lecter after learning of his crimes. Calling himself The Great Red Dragon (because of his obsession with the William Blake painting,&quot;The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun&quot;),Dolarhyde is unable to control his violent and sexual urges,which turns him into a dangerous serial killer. These conditions were born from the systematic child abuse he suffered at the hands of his grandmother.&#x0A;Graham continues to run into complications,the first being Freddy Lounds,a tabloid reporter whom Graham despises from the days following the conviction of Dr. Lecter and who now follows Graham relentlessly for leads on the Tooth Fairy story. Further complicating the investigation is the secret correspondence between Lecter and Dolarhyde,where Lecter provides Dolarhyde with Graham&apos;s home address,endangering Graham&apos;s wife and child,who are evacuated to a remote farm which belongs to Crawford&apos;s brother. Graham discovers the secret communication and tries to intercept it without Lecter&apos;s knowledge but the doctor is quick to realise that the Feds are onto him and his protegÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© and humiliates the authorities by upping the stakes: in return for his help in capturing the Tooth Fairy,he requests a first-class meal in his cell and having his book privileges returned.Hoping to lure the Tooth Fairy into a trap,Graham gives Lounds an interview in which he gives disparaging details about what the FBI believe the killer to be: impotent and pathetic whereas in fact they consider him cunning and highly dangerous. This provokes Dolarhyde but instead of Graham he kidnaps Lounds,tortures him,forces him to recant his allegations before setting him on fire and depositing him outside his newspaper&apos;s offices.&#x0A;At about the same time,Dolarhyde falls in love with a blind co-worker named Reba McClane. Dolarhyde&apos;s new-found love conflicts with his homicidal urges,which manifest themselves in his mind as &apos;The Great Red Dragon&apos;. After his association with Reba,Dolarhyde attempts to stop the Dragon&apos;s &quot;possession&quot; of him. In order to stop killing,he believes that he must dominate the dragon by consuming the original painting. Dolarhyde goes to the Brooklyn Museum,beats a museum secretary unconscious,and eats the original Blake watercolor of The Red Dragon.Graham eventually realizes that the killer knew the layout of his victims&apos; houses from their home videos,which he only could have seen if he worked for the home video editing company that transfers home movies to video cassette. Dolarhyde&apos;s job gives him access to all home movies that pass through the company. When he sees Graham interviewing his boss,Dolarhyde realises that they are on to him and goes to see Reba one last time. He finds her talking to a co-worker,Ralph Mandy,a man whom she actually dislikes. Enraged,Dolarhyde kills Ralph Mandy,kidnaps McClane and,having taken her to his house,sets the place on fire. He intends to kill her and then himself,but finds himself unable to shoot her. After Dolarhyde apparently shoots himself,McClane escapes.Graham is given Dolarhyde&apos;s scrapbook,saved from the wreckage of the house,which details the killer&apos;s tragic childhood and obsessions with murder. Despite himself,Graham feels pity for Dolarhyde,who he realizes was made a monster,not born one.&#x0A;However,it turns out Dolarhyde did not shoot himself but left behind the body of Ralph Mandy in order to stage his own death. Dolarhyde then surprises Graham at his Florida home,holding Graham&apos;s son at knifepoint. In order to save the boy,Graham slings insults at his son that are reminiscent of the ones that Dolarhyde&apos;s grandmother had used against him,which Graham found in the scrapbook. This enrages Dolarhyde,who attacks Graham,allowing his son to escape to safety. Both Graham and Dolarhyde are severely wounded in a close-range shootout with each other when Graham&apos;s wife,Molly,ends the horrific ordeal by shooting and killing Dolarhyde.After recovering,Graham receives a letter from Lecter,which bids him well and hopes that he isn&apos;t too &quot;disfigured&quot;. Dr. Frederick Chilton then informs Lecter that there is a young woman from the FBI waiting to speak with him (presumably Clarice Starling). Lecter thinks for a minute,looks up,and asks what her name is.</Plot>

        <Plot>Lisa Reisert (played by Rachel McAdams) has a fear of flying,and after attending her grandmother&apos;s funeral in Dallas,Texas,she has to take a night flight (called a red-eye flight; hence the movie title) to Miami,Florida. While in the check-in line she meets an old lady who is interested in Lisa&apos;s Dr. Phil book. She tells her she&apos;s a fan,Lisa gives the old lady her book saying she has already read it. She then meets Jackson Rippner (played by Cillian Murphy) whom she initially finds charming and ends up having a drink with him while they wait to board their delayed flight.When boarding,Lisa is pleasantly surprised to find that her seat is next to Jackson&apos;s. After the plane takes off,Rippner reveals that he is a terrorist operative working for a group who intends to assassinate the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Charles Keefe (played by Jack Scalia) and his family,and Lisa is instrumental in their plans because of her job at the Lux Atlantic Hotel (where the Keefe family is staying) as acting manager. If she refuses to cooperate,Rippner will deploy a hitman to kill her father,Joe (played by Brian Cox) at his home in Miami. Reisert has no way of getting help without jeopardizing her father&apos;s safety,and the longer she waits,the harder it will be to prevent the murder.She tries desperately to save the day. Her first attempt is when the old lady from the check-in line comes to talk to her about the book. She tries to write a warning in the womens&apos;s book. However,Rippner later finds out,and he headbutts her unconscious. She tries again by going into the bathroom and writing a warning on the mirror with soap. She tries to leave the bathroom,but is stopped again. Rippner sees the message and shoves her back in.Lisa begs Rippner not to kill her father. He responds to her by telling her not to gamble with her father&apos;s life. He then notices the scar above Lisa&apos;s breast and begins asking her about the scar&apos;s history. Lisa refuses to answer and Rippner then starts choking her because she is not being honest with him when he had been nothing but brutally honest with her. After letting go of her throat,he starts erasing the writing on the mirror while she is gasping for breath.The assassination plan is to use a portable missile launcher from a boat in a nearby harbor and fire it at the hotel. The problem is that the Deputy Secretary likes to stay in a different suite,one that faces the city (away from the harbor). In order to assassinate him,Rippner must force Lisa to make a phone call from the airplane and order the hotel staff to change his reservation from Room 3825 to a particular suite (Suite 4080) that faces the harbor.After one failed attempt due to turbulence from the storm in which the telephone was disconnected,Lisa successfully makes the phone call,and the hotel staff moves the politician to the targeted suite. Rippner still needs Lisa as he can&apos;t let her and her father go until he gets a phone call confirming that the Keefes are successfully asassinated. The Secret Service checks and clears that room,and the Secretary settles in with his family.After the airplane lands and arrives at the gate,Lisa tells Rippner about the history of her scar,before stabbing Rippner in the throat with a pen,stealing his cell phone and bolting off the plane into the terminal. Lisa runs through the airport,narrowly escaping both airport security and Rippner. She steals a SUV to give herself time to use the cell phone. She makes a cell phone call to the hotel to warn them to evacuate immediately and that the deputy director is a target of an assassination plot. The Secret Service gets the Secretary and his family out of the room just seconds before the Javelin missile is fired and hits the hotel. Her second call is to her father; however,the cell phone battery dies and she is forced to drive to her father&apos;s house in order to save him before Rippner can call the hitman.At the end of the film,Lisa rushes to her father&apos;s house to see if he&apos;s safe. She finds the hitman outside the front door,where she runs him over with the SUV,crashing through the front of the house. Lisa&apos;s father stumbles out of the kitchen,shocked at the man who was lying dead in the foyer and tells her that the police are already on their way.While Lisa calls her hotel to see if everything is alright,Jackson Rippner shows up and knocks out her father so that he can deal with her first. He chases her through the house with a knife and throws her down a flight of stairs. Lisa crawls down the last few steps,where a gun is lying next to the dead hitman. She threatens Jackson with the gun. Jackson attempts to escape,but Lisa shoots him before he can. He kicks the gun out of her hand and grabs her by the hair when finally,Lisa&apos;s father shoots Rippner as the police arrive,though whether he actually dies is unknown.At the hotel,the Homeland Secretary and the Secret Service are grateful to Lisa and her assistant Cynthia,who also helped save the day by pulling the fire alarm.</Plot>

        <Plot>In 2025,a corporation called The Union has perfected the creation of artificial organs,which have replaced organ transplants. A potential customer can apply for an organ,which are sold on credit,at high interest. If a customer is unable to maintain payments,after three months,a repo-man is sent after the customer to &apos;reclaim&apos; Union property. The process of the repossession is bloody &amp; brutal,and often results in the death of the customer.Remy is one of the Union&apos;s top repo-men,who partners with his childhood friend,Jake,to collect on past due accounts. Remy is highly regarded within The Union as their top performer,though his occupation causes problems with his wife,who sees it as unsavory. After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home,Remy decides to transfer to a sales job,much to Jake&apos;s chagrin.As his final repossession job,Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer,whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song,Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit,the defibrillator malfunctions,sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma,he is informed by Jake and Frank,his co-workers,that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart,or die. After Remy attempts to flee the hospital,he reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work,but is unable to perform his job,because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales,but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest,which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union,but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession,after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was expected to repossess artiforgs,and knocked out.Remy,upon awakening,encounters Beth,whom he had met earlier in a bar where she was singing. He discovers that she has multiple body parts on which she is past due,and is currently suffering from a drug addiction. Remy takes her to a motel room,where he stays with her as she goes through withdrawal. After Jake interrupts his attempt to falsify artiforg returns on both of them back at the Union&apos;s headquarters,Remy leaves unassailed by Jake,returns to Beth,&amp; the two leave to live in the outskirts.The pair live,for a time,in relative harmony. Remy uses an old typewriter that Beth had found to type up a narrative of his life,and subsequent conversion. As he finishes,a repo-man arrives to repossess his heart,but as he approaches Remy,he falls through a hole Remy has covered in the damaged floor,crashing to the floor below,unconscious. Then Beth,who was hiding behind the door,also falls when the floor collapses under her,re-injuring her leg. From above,Remy sees the Repo man coming to,readying to tranquilize or taze Beth. Remy drops the heavy typewriter onto him thru the floor,crushing his head,to save himself and Beth. Using the repo-man&apos;s vehicle,Remy sneaks back into his former workplace to obtain a pair of devices that fool organ scanners used by repo-men. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account,only to discover that due to his previous aborted attempt,all accounts can now only be cleared back at the Union&apos;s central office.Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport,but are taken by security when it is discovered that Beth&apos;s prosthetic knee was damaged due to their earlier encounter with the repo-man. Once inside,they are forced to fight against airport security and another pair of repo-men. They are able to kill or incapacitate all of them,and while escaping,come face to face thru impenetrable safety glass,with Jake,who has now been assigned Remy&apos;s account. The pair head to a black market doctor,where Beth&apos;s knee is replaced. After the procedure,the two are stopped by Jake,who has tracked the pair. A bitter fight ensues,during which Jake revealed that it as he who rigged the defibrillator unit to malfunction,necessitating Remy&apos;s heart replacement; he did this intending to ensure that Remy would have to keep his organ repossession job,so they could get promoted together. The two fight,but Jake gains the upper hand,and knocks Remy unconscious by hitting him in the head with a heavy steel chain &amp; hook.Remy is awakened by Beth,and as they escape a raid by the Union&apos;s repo-men,they are pulled into a safe house by an underground network of artiforg refugees. The two survive the night,but Remy is overcome with remorse after finding the corpses of the victims of the Union raid. He resolves to destroy the corporation and clear the accounts of Beth and himself. After passing his story to his son during a brief meeting on a train,the pair travel to The Union&apos;s headquarters,hoping to remove themselves from the system. Remy and Beth are pursued throughout the building,and after an intense battle against Remy&apos;s former colleagues,arrive at the Pink Door,the main database for the Union. Scanning Beth&apos;s prosthetic eye,they are able to seal themselves inside just as Jake and Frank arrive. Once inside,they discover that the server does not have any interface,except for a scanner. Remy realizes that the only way to remove themselves from the system is to repo their artif-orgs. Remy and Beth cut themselves open in order to use the scanner internally,clearing their accounts.Jake and Frank are able to enter through the use of an artificial organ,and see Remy trying desperately to resuscitate Beth,who has stopped breathing during the process. Jake asks Remy if she was worth all the hardship and pain that he has put himself through,which he confirms. Frank pulls a gun to kill Remy,but Jake turns on his employer,stabbing him with a knife. Jake then assists Remy in reviving Beth,after which he deposits two explosives inside the organ return unit. The explosion destroys the Union&apos;s mainframe,wiping all the client account records out of the system.Later,Remy is on a tropical beach,enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text from earlier in the film has been published into a book,The Repossesion Mambo. Remy turns to look at Jake,but instead the background flickers and voices are heard. It is revealed that Remy,in fact,sustained brain injury when Jake hit him with the metal hook earlier in the film. Jake,out of guilt &amp; remorse,has paid off Remy&apos;s account and has had him placed on a Neural Network machine,allowing him to live the rest of his life in a dream. Beth is still alive but unconscious,and when questioned as to what to do with her,Jake replies he&apos;ll &quot;take care of her&quot;. This renders the second half of the film as simply a fantasy of Remy&apos;s. Jake finds Remy&apos;s manuscript,which he greets with a bitter chuckle,as his former partner is wheeled away,presumably to spend the rest of his days in his fantasy world. The film ends with Frank delivering his usual sales pitch in a commercial,then back to Remy&apos;s beach fantasy,where Jake is handing him a tropical drink,saying,&quot;A little fruit,for the fruit?&quot; (now,a &apos;vegetable&apos;!) Remy leans back,looks down at Beth walking by the water,sips,smiles,and laughs.</Plot>

        <Plot>Jake Green (Jason Statham) finds himself in prison for seven years. He spends this time in solitary confinement,with two mysterious characters also serving solitary in the cells on either side of him (one a con man,the other a chess master). While in solitary,Jake and the other two exchange thoughts on chess and the perfect con via handwritten messages slipped inside of provisional books that the three share. Jake comes to learn the makings of a perfect con,but never fully grasps its depth and relevancy to him until much,much later. In the course of these exchanges,Jake reveals a lot about himself to the other two. Jake never meets these two men face to face. The two prisoners plan to break out of prison and agree to break Jake out as well. The next day,the two escape,leaving Jake behind. He feels cheated.Jake remains in prison while the two escaped convicts steal all the money Jake had hidden &quot;on the outside&quot;. They trusted Jake with the formula; Jake trusted them as to the whereabouts of his money...a LOT of money. They take the money,leaving in its place,a message on a card:The first rule of any game - YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Cut to two years later.When Jake gets out of prison,broke and penniless,he starts to practice what he understands of the formula and of the con he learned from his time in solitary. Its very successful and he does very well in world of gambling,he seemingly learned a valuable lesson from the two conmen inside.Once Jake is up on his feet again (financially speaking),he takes on his nemesis the power hungry Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Jake enters Macha&apos;s casino with his brothers in tow,and is swiftly summoned before Macha to play a game of chance. En route to Macha&apos;s game,they must take an elevator up 22 floors,where it is revealed Jake suffers from extreme claustrophobia following his years in solitary,and must suppress an anxiety attack to make the journey. At the game,Jake beats him in a game of chance,humiliating Macha. Fearing more of the same,Macha wants revenge and orders a hit on Jake. As Jake and his brothers leave the casino,Jake is approached by a mysterious man (Zach),who offers him assistance and hands him a note reading &quot;take the elevator.&quot; Jake cannot face the return journey and opts to take the stairs,but blacks out unexpectedly,falls down the stairs and is rushed to the hospital. The doctors report he is very ill but do not disclose why he had the blackout. Macha puts out the order for a hit on Jake,asking professional killer Sorter (Mark Strong) to take care of things. Jake arrives home,without Billy,to be welcomed by one of Macha&apos;s hits. Jake is the only one who survives,being rescued by the mysterious Zach. Sorter is confounded by Jake&apos;s escape and survival,unaccustomed to his hits going wrong,which instigates a quiet,intense process of self-questioning in the otherwise passionless killer.Zach takes Jake to his equally mysterious partner,Avi,who produces the results of his hospital tests and informs him that he is in desperate physical trouble from an internal disease,with only three days to live. He tells Jake he and his partner can save him from both Macha and his physical aliment.Simultaneously,Macha is trying to get into business with the infamous,but apparently invisible Sam Gold. He makes a deal with his female representative Lily Walker (who represents the queen on the chess board). Macha is warned if he does not come through on the deal that Sam Gold will be very disappointed. Macha is after the reward of being in business with Gold (who represents the opponent) and foresees no problem.The deal is for some white powder,which represents vice of multiple manifestations,in other words,false ways to escape the wrath of Gold or win the game,but perversely these just bring you closer to him.Jake agrees to do whatever the two mysterious characters tell him to do (a gun to the head so to speak - he has three days to live),there is no time to haggle,and he is prepared to do whatever hes told by these characters. Avi (André Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore) appear to be loan sharks and gradually force Jake to give away all his money that he made using the con,much to his despair. This is so painful that it seems to be killing a part of him,as Avi and Zach force him to do whatever he hates to do. Jake is repeatedly forced into elevators,taking him on a physiological and psychological ride from hell. They also sabotage Macha&apos;s deal with Gold,putting Macha in jeopardy with Gold and forcing Macha to seek the powder from a rival crime boss,Lord Jon (Tom Wu). To make matters worse,they sabotage the deal with Lord Jon to make it appear that each gang is responsible for the treachery. These two gangs begin to destroy one another through their ignorance and greed.Jake&apos;s journey climaxes when Avi and Zach,now his masters,ask Jake to shoot a man that didn&apos;t pay a debt. Jake refuses,going against the voice in his head. This is the turning point and just when Jake has had enough he forces the two mysterious characters to reveal their game. Is he ready for the answer? What is the point of putting him through all this pain?Avi and Zach simply repeat the treasured formula that Jake learned in prison and which the audience is told at the start of the film.The first rule of any game: YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Jake now realizes that he has fallen victim to this &quot;perfect con&quot;,that he is actually the pawn in the game,and his opponent (&quot;Sam Gold&quot;),resides inside Jake&apos;s head - &quot;the last place he would ever look&quot; (another component of the perfect con formula) Sam Gold is a metaphor camouflaged as fear,ego,evil,the Devil.Now armed with this information which has been so elusive,Jake goes to war with himself. He realizes the game Avi and Zach have made him play has been to diminish the Sam Gold within himself - and that is why he felt like he was dying,because a part of him was.This game it seems is back to front. Jake gives away his remaining money to a charity in Dorothy Macha&apos;s name and Macha takes the credit. At this point we understand that the voice we hear in the film as a voice over is not a voice over at all,it&apos;s the Sam Gold in each of the character&apos;s heads.Macha is being fattened up by the voice in his head who encourages Macha to take the credit.To conquer the game that Jake now realizes he is in,he goes to Macha and humiliates himself,begging for forgiveness at the foot of his bed. This goes completely against the voice in Jakes head,which is now in major agony. Leaving Macha&apos;s bedroom,Jake takes an elevator that gets stuck,(his worst nightmare,as he is claustrophobic) but here is where a real battle takes place. Jake induces the pain &quot;Sam Gold&quot; hides behind. Sam Gold tries every technique to control and debilitate Jake,but Jake is now detached enough from the voice to fall for it. &quot;Embrace the pain and you will win this game&quot; -- in doing this,Jake completely sheds himself of Sam Gold. Immediately upon doing so,the elevator starts up. He realizes that though free from the physical prison he knew for seven years,he was still a prisoner - of his own mind. Upon facing and defeating his fear,he is profoundly free.As the elevator doors open,there stands a confused and angry Macha with a gun in his hand. He can&apos;t understand what game Jake is playing,but Jake no longer cares about Macha. Gun or no gun,Jake walks straight past Macha. Because Jake no longer fears him,Macha breaks down. His ego can&apos;t handle this,he falls prey to the voice he hears inside his head,the voice of his own &quot;Sam Gold&quot;. Still unaware of who Sam Gold really is,and where he resides,Macha agonizes over his knowledge that Sam Gold is going to come and get him. What he doesnt realize is that Sam Gold is already getting him - from the inside.Jake makes a large donation of money to a charity in Macha&apos;s name,further conquering the Sam Gold within him,while augmenting the Sam Gold within Macha,who happily takes the credit and public acclaim. Macha is at first magnanimous towards Jake following this gesture,however on learning that Jake had orchestrated the sabotage on the &apos;powder&apos; deals,Macha orders him dead with renewed vigour. Macha&apos;s men find Jakes brother and niece at his home. While Macha&apos;s henchmen are in the process of torturing Jake&apos;s brother and threatening his little girl,the previously passive Sorter concludes his process of self-questioning and steps in,methodically executing all of Macha&apos;s men only to be outgunned in the end by the last surviving member of the gang,who takes Jake&apos;s niece back to Macher.Jake,now understanding that the mysterious characters Avi and Zach are not who he thought they were,finishes a game of chess in Macha&apos;s casino with Avi. Here it is revealed that Avi could have beaten him at any time. Avi tells him one of the rules again,the art is for the opponent to feed pieces to the victim to make them believe they took those pieces because they are smarter and you are dumber. Jake realizes that these are the two associates from Solitary confinement that he spent seven years living between while in prison. They promised they would break him out of prison and they did,its just Jake didn&apos;t realize it was the prison of his mind and how big that prison was. Avi and Zach confide they did not help him because they liked him,but because they ARE him - they are aspects,or projections,of his own higher self. Meanwhile,Jake&apos;s Sam Gold persona grew from Jake&apos;s activities on emerging from prison,fooling his enemies into thinking he was making them rich when instead he was siphoning their money away from them,just as the ego grows rich from encouraging excess and a sense of entitlement in those within whom it resides.Jake confronts Macha,who is holding his niece hostage. Jake continues to be unafraid of Macha,who continues to be unnerved by his lack of fear - the &quot;Sam Gold&quot; inside Macha is screaming with rage,pride,fear,while Macha himself is consumed by doubt and panic. Macha is convinced Sam Gold is coming to kill him for screwing up the &apos;powder&apos; delivery,and the &quot;Sam Gold&quot; within Macha - his ego - whispers &quot;you can&apos;t kill someone who&apos;s already dead.&quot; Ultimately,his pride and fear lead Macha to suicide rather than kill Jake or his niece. Sam Gold wins.In the end it&apos;s a story about realizing that the prison is the mind and the ego is the hidden master of that environment. The only real enemy to have ever existed is within; it is fear. The external world is determined,to great degree,by ones fear. Fear is the opponent in life,and as you get smarter so does he. Once it&apos;s recognized for what it is,it can be mastered,but without recognition of this situation,you are simply an unconscious slave and the game hasn&apos;t gone full circle.</Plot>

        <Plot>Michael Sullivan Sr.,is an enforcer to John Rooney,an Irish-American crime boss in Illinois during the Great Depression. Sullivan,an orphan raised by Rooney,worked for the crime boss most of his life. Sullivan and Rooney&apos;s son,Connor,are sent by Rooney to talk to Finn McGovern,a disgruntled employee. Sullivan&apos;s son,twelve-year-old Michael Sullivan,Jr.,stows away in his father&apos;s car,attempting to learn more about his enigmatic father&apos;s ambiguous profession. He witnesses Connor&apos;s impulsive killing of McGovern,and is soon after discovered by Connor and his father. Although Sullivan Sr. swears that his son will tell no-one,Connor attempts to ensure his own protection by attempting to have Sullivan Sr. killed,while murdering the rest of Sullivan&apos;s family himself. Connor kills Sullivan&apos;s wife,Annie,and younger son,Peter; Sullivan Sr. and his son,Michael Sullivan Jr.,escape with their lives and flee to Chicago.Sullivan requests assistance from a Lieutenant in Al Capone&apos;s crime syndicate,Frank Nitti,in order to get revenge on Connor,but when he is rejected,Sullivan and his son begin a string of mob-owned bank robberies in order to steal the syndicate&apos;s laundered money. Sullivan hopes to coerce Capone into giving Connor up for the money,but instead Capone dispatches assassin Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan and his son. Maguire sets up a trap for Sullivan with the aid of Rooney&apos;s accountant,Alexander Rance. Sullivan arrives at Rance&apos;s hotel room,seeking assistance,and Rance stalls him long enough for Maguire to arrive at his room. Rance is killed in the crossfire of the ensuing gunfight,but Sullivan escapes with a bullet wound in his left arm. Maguire escapes as well,though his face is left disfigured from a debris wound. Sullivan Jr. takes his father to a farm in the country where a childless,elderly couple takes the two of them in. During his recuperation,Sullivan finds in ledgers taken from Rance&apos;s hotel room that Connor had been embezzling money from his father under the names of gang members that he had murdered.When Sullivan Sr. recovers,he secretly meets with John Rooney during Mass and shares his discovery about Connor. Rooney not only reveals that he had been aware of Connor&apos;s treachery all along,but remains adamant in his refusal to let his son be harmed. Sullivan Sr. ambushes John Rooney and his bodyguards in the street,picking them off with his Thompson submachine gun from an alley before approaching Rooney face to face. Rooney says,&quot;I&apos;m glad it&apos;s you&quot; before Sullivan Sr. tearfully unloads the last of his ammunition into him. With Rooney dead,Capone is bereft of any reason to protect Connor. Capone uses Frank Nitti as a middleman as he gives Sullivan Sr. Connor&apos;s exact location,on the condition that Sullivan Sr. gives his word that his spree will end with Connor&apos;s death. Sullivan Sr. leaves a letter for his son before going to the hotel at which Connor is staying. Connor&apos;s bodyguards allow him straight,unhindered passage to Connor,who is bathing in his room. Sullivan Sr.,saying nothing,draws his pistol and fires three rounds into Connor&apos;s head,then leaves. Apparently free from pursuit,Sullivan and his son make their way to the town of Perdition,Michigan. A disfigured Maguire surprises Michael Sullivan Sr. in the summer house of Sarah (Annie&apos;s sister). Maguire shoots Sullivan Sr. from behind. He sets his gun on a table behind him and begins setting up his camera to take a picture of the dying Sullivan Sr.,in accordance to his MO. However,Maguire soon finds himself at gunpoint by Sullivan&apos;s son with his own weapon. Maguire attempts to convince Sullivan Jr. to discard the weapon,and Sullivan Sr. pleads with his son not to fire,thereby following his father&apos;s path,which had always been his greatest fear. Sullivan Sr. shoots Maguire from behind before his son can pull the trigger,then dies in Sullivan Jr.&apos;s arms. Sullivan Jr. mourns his father&apos;s death and finds his way to the same elderly couple that had helped him and his father,assuming the life of a farmer&apos;s son.</Plot>

        <Plot>Lenny Cole (Wilkinson) is a crime boss who calls the shots in London&apos;s underworld and real estate market. We learn all about Lenny from Archy (Strong) his second in command who serves as the film&apos;s narrator. When a wealthy Russian property dealer by the name of Yuri Omovich (Roden) looks to Lenny for help on a major new deal,Lenny is eager to assist (for a very large fee,of course). Yuri agrees to pay,and as a show of faith,he insists that Lenny borrow his &quot;lucky&quot; painting. Yuri then asks his accountant,Stella (Newton),to transfer the money to Lenny,but Stella arrangers for a band of thieves known as the The Wild Bunch consisting of One Two (Butler) and Mumbles (Elba) to intercept the money before it reaches him and split the cash among the three of them. To make matters worse,the lucky painting has mysteriously been stolen,and the number one suspect is Lenny&apos;s estranged stepson,crack-addicted rock star Johnny Quid,who is presumed dead. As Lenny desperately tries to locate the painting,Yuri calls in sadistic henchmen to recover his money.In an attempt to find Johnny,Lenny and Archy enlist his former record producers Mickey (Ludacris) and Roman (Piven) to track him down or else their concerts and clubs will be shut down. Meanwhile,Handsome Bob (Hardy) is distraught on the night before his court case,he&apos;s scheduled to do a five year prison stretch. One Two organizes a party for Bob. On the way to the party,One Two tries to cheer Bob up to no avail. Bob then comes out to One Two,admitting to having a crush on One Two. One Two is disgusted,but thinking that it&apos;s Bob&apos;s last night as a free man,asks him what exactly he&apos;d like to do. The next day,One Two refuses to attend Bob&apos;s court hearing to the surprise of Mumble. One Two uncomfortably tries to explain that something happened between him and Bob the previous night,when Mumbles tells him that everyone knows that Bob is gay.When One Two,Mumbles,and Bob try to steal a second load of Yuri&apos;s money they are wounded and chased by Yuri&apos;s persistent hired mercenaries who engage them in a shootout and a lengthy foot chase. They nevertheless deliver the money to Stella as they did before. By this time Yuri has grown impatient and come to suspect that Lenny is involved in the theft of the cash and his painting. Yuri has Lenny viciously beaten,demanding that the painting be returned and the money delivered. Two item peddling junkies manage to steal the painting from Johnny and sell it to the Wild Bunch,and One Two promptly gives it to Stella after they have sex. Mickey and Roman find Johnny and call Archy to have him delivered. After capturing the three,Archy and Lenny&apos;s men go to apprehend One Two who is already in the hands of Yuri&apos;s vengeful mercenaries. Archy and his men kill the mercenaries and kidnap One Two as well as Mumbles and Handsome Bob who arrived to deliver the name of a much talked about police informant inside the London underworld.Yuri arrives at Stella&apos;s house to seal their arrangements while also asking her to marry him,as he has been smitten with her for a long time. Immediately after asking,Yuri spots his lucky painting in Stella&apos;s living room. After being asked how long she&apos;s had it,Stella says she&apos;s had it for years,not knowing it&apos;s actually Yuri&apos;s. Feeling betrayed and enraged,Yuri orders his associate inside to kill Stella.Meanwhile,Archy brings Johnny,the Wild Bunch,Mickey,and Roman to Lenny&apos;s warehouse where Johnny begins to verbally provoke Lenny. Lenny then shoots Johnny in the stomach before he finishes telling Archy that Lenny is the famous rat. Lenny then orders Johnny,Roman,and Mickey escorted downstairs while demanding that the Wild Bunch to tell him where the money is. Handsome Bob offers Archy the documents in his jacket pocket which reveals the informant,code named &quot;Sidney Shaw,&quot; to be Lenny. Lenny had arranged with the police to give up many of his associates for prison at any given time in exchange for his freedom. One Two,Mumbles,and Archy himself are among the people Lenny has ratted out over the years,and Archy had served over four years in jail because of this. With this new information brought to light,Archy frees the Wild Bunch and kills Lenny.In the meantime,Johnny,Mickey,Roman and two of Lenny&apos;s men are in an elevator on their way to a spot where Lenny&apos;s gangsters will execute them and dispose of their bodies. Johnny informs Mickey and Roman in detail about how they will be killed along with him. This prompts Lenny&apos;s men to act prematurely,but thanks to Johnny&apos;s warning Mickey and Roman react in time,and after a struggle manage to kill the gangsters. When they make it to the ground floor,Johnny kills two more guards waiting outside the lift. The Wild Bunch save them from the last remaining henchman (One-Two knocks him out from behind) and they all escape.Some time later,Archy picks up a rehabilitated but still eccentric Johnny Quid from the hospital. Archy offers Yuri&apos;s lucky painting to Johnny as a peace offering and &quot;welcome home present,&quot; which Johnny accepts. Archy reveals to Johnny that obtaining the painting &quot;cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg.&quot; The film closes with Johnny proclaiming that with his new freedom,he will do what he couldn&apos;t do before: &quot;become a real RocknRolla&quot;. During the end credits,it is revealed that One Two and Bob had danced together on the night before Bob&apos;s court hearing.</Plot>

        <Plot>The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939,shortly after the outbreak of World War II,when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson),a successful businessman,arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture goods for the German military. Schindler,an opportunistic member of the Nazi party,lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military,Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise,he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley),a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory,Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as &quot;Herr Direktor,&quot; while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler&apos;s factory are allowed outside the ghetto,and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed &quot;essential&quot; by the Nazi bureaucracy,which saves them from being transported to concentration camps,or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby,Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto,sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests,is uncooperative,elderly,or infirm,or for no reason at all. Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area,and is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Göth and,through Stern&apos;s attention to bribery,he continues to enjoy the SS&apos;s support and protection. The camp is built outside the city at Paszów. During this time,Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp for his workers,with the motive of keeping them safe from the depredations of the guards. Eventually,an order arrives from Berlin commanding Göth to exhume and destroy all bodies of those killed in the Krakow ghetto,dismantle Paszów,and to ship the remaining Jews to Auschwitz. Schindler prevails upon Göth to let him keep &quot;his&quot; workers so that he can move them to a factory in his old home of Zwittau-Brinnlitz,in Moravia -- away from the &quot;final solution&quot; now fully under way in occupied Poland. Göth acquiesces,charging a certain amount for each worker. Schindler and Stern assemble a list of workers that should keep them off the trains to Auschwitz.&quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; comprises these &quot;skilled&quot; inmates,and for many of those in Paszów,being included means the difference between life and death. Almost all of the people on Schindler&apos;s list arrive safely at the new site,with the exception to the train carrying the women and the children,which is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz. There,the women are directed to what they believe is a gas chamber; but they see only water falling from the showers. The day after,the women are shown waiting in line for work. In the meantime,Schindler had rushed immediately to Auschwitz to solve the problem and to get the women out of Auschwitz; to this end he bribes the camp commander,Rudolf Höss (Hans-Michael Rehberg),with a cache of diamonds so that he is able to spare all the women and the children. However,a last problem arises just when all the women are boarding the train because several SS officers attempt to hold some children back and prevent them from leaving. Schindler,there to personally oversee the boarding,steps in and is successful in obtaining from the officers the release of the children. Once the Schindler women arrive in Zwittau-Brinnlitz,Schindler institutes firm controls on the Nazi guards assigned to the factory; summary executions are forbidden,abuse of the workers is as well and the Nazi guards are not allowed on the factory floor. Schindler also permits the Jews to observe the Sabbath,and spends much of his fortune acquired in Poland bribing Nazi officials. In his home town,he surprises his wife while she&apos;s in church during mass,and tells her that she is the only woman in his life (despite having been shown previously to be a womanizer). She goes with him to the factory to assist him. He runs out of money just as the German army surrenders,ending the war in Europe.As a German Nazi and self-described &quot;profiteer of slave labor,&quot; Schindler must flee the oncoming Soviet Red Army. After dismissing the Nazi guards to return to their families,he packs a car in the night,and bids farewell to his workers. They give him a letter explaining he is not a criminal to them,together with a ring engraved with the Talmudic quotation,&quot;He who saves the life of one man,saves the world entire.&quot; Schindler is touched but deeply distraught,feeling he could&apos;ve done more to save many more lives. He leaves with his wife during the night,dressed in Polish prisoner clothes,posing as refugees. The Schindler Jews,having slept outside the factory gates through the night,are awakened by sunlight the next morning. A Soviet dragoon arrives and announces to the Jews that they have been liberated by the Red Army. The Jews walk to a nearby town in search of food. As they walk abreast,the frame changes to another of the Schindler Jews in the present day (in color) at the grave of Oskar Schindler in Israel. The film ends with a procession of now-aged Jews who worked in Schindler&apos;s factory,each of whom reverently sets a stone on his grave. The actors portraying the major characters walk hand-in-hand with the people they portrayed,also placing stones on Schindler&apos;s grave as they pass. The audience learns that the survivors and descendants of the approximately 1,100 Jews sheltered by Schindler now number over 6,000. The Jewish population of Poland,once numbering in the millions,was at the time of the film&apos;s release approximately 4,000. In the final scene,a man (Neeson himself,though his face is not visible) places a pair of roses on the grave,and stands contemplatively over it.</Plot>

        <Plot>As the film opens,we are with sniper Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his scout Donny Fenn (Lane Garrison) lying in wait in the hills of Ethiopia,ready to deliver covering fire for a US convoy heading back to base through hostile country. They pass the time with small talk: Donny looks at a photo of his wife,Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below,a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver,each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear,firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically shoots and kills numerous hostiles,allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper&apos;s position,and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base,their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection,as the Americans aren&apos;t supposed to be in the country,and Swagger and Donny are abandoned,left to fend for themselves,left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR,and returns fire on the helicopter,bringing it down in flames. As the helicopter explodes,this episode fades,with Swagger,abandoned,and fighting his way home alone.Three years later Swagger is a private citizen,living in the mountains,a recluse from the world that abandoned him. Unshaven and long haired,he lives alone; his only companion his dog,trained to open the fridge and take out a cold beer for Bobby Lee as he returns to his cabin. Sharing a slurp of the beer with his dog,Swagger turns on his PC and the Internet,looking at news of a world that mostly has him shaking his head. Cutting away to a military office,wheelchair-bound Michael Sandor (Rade Serbedzija),Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover),Jack Payne (Elias Koteas),and Louis Dobbler (Jonathan Walker) are planning an op: Sandor recommends Swagger,and they discuss his past... this lost soul,covert-ops hero now turned loner,seems perfect for their needs. Bouncing up the woodland track,Johnson and his men drive out to meet Swagger.Alerted by his barking dog,Swagger is alerted as the men approach his cabin. Johnson introduces himself to Swagger,flaunting his own Medal of Honor. Tension mounts,as Swagger is not interested in talking,and when Payne tries to lure the dog to him,Swagger warns him off. Tension escalates as Payne reaches slowly down towards his gun and Swagger readies a hidden blade. Johnson calms the situation,convincing Swagger to give him five-minutes. Payne and Dobbler wait outside as Johnson explains their presence: they have received information about a planned assassination attempt on the president and,with a mole in one of their agencies,they&apos;ve turned for help to Swagger. One of their few intelligence clues is that the assassin&apos;s shot will be taken from over a mile,a shot which few men can make. Still Swagger wants nothing to do with the plan,but Johnson insists. The president will travel to three different cities,and Johnson wants Swagger to travel to each and scout potential places for a sniper. Feelings of patriotism,or perhaps habit begin to change Swaggers mind. Still,as Johnson prepares to leave,Swagger takes a picture of as he admires their truck&apos;s engine. As they drive back down the mountain,Swagger&apos;s professional suspicion is understood by Johnson and his men they know he didnt take a picture of the engine,but of their license plate. But he&apos;s agreed to their plan.Swagger sets up a can of beef stew and practices the beyond a mile shot,nailing it with complete accuracy. Swagger cuts his hair and trims his beard. As he cleans his guns he tells his dog that he&apos;ll be gone for a couple of days.True to his word,Swagger scouts each location in turn,reporting back to Johnson that the likely location is Philadelphia. Johnson wants Swagger there to help catch the assassin. Spooling forward to the day of the speech,snipers are everywhere,along with federal agents including Nick Memphis (Michael Pena). Swagger stands in nearby office with Johnson,Payne,and Dobbler,and a pudgy police officer who Payne introduces as Timmons (Alan C. Peterson). Johnson claims the shooter is in a church tower nearby,and says that they will take him down just after the president begins to speak,but Swagger&apos;s eye is taken by the fact that Timmons&apos; gun is not properly holstered. The president is scheduled to speak immediately after the Archbishop of Ethiopia,who is accepting an award. As the president approaches the stand,Swagger urges Johnson to have his men take down the shooter immediately,but at that moment events lurch forward: the Arch Bishop is shot in the head,and Timmons fires on Swagger,catching him in the shoulder. Swagger falls out of a window,landing hard on a glass ceiling below. Timmons leans out and shoots Swagger in the stomach,driving him through the glass ceiling. As Payne&apos;s team men pack up their things he abuses Timmons for not killing Swagger. They leave the only belongings left behind are Swaggers sniper rifle and a bullet. Payne orders Timmons to finish Swagger off.Swagger is on the run for his life. He stumbles into Memphis,asking for his help. Memphis draws his gun but Swagger flips him over hard on the ground. He &apos;cuffs Memphis to a gate,telling that he was set up and Timmons is in on it. Grabbing Memphis&apos;s gun,Swagger drives off in his car. Timmons catches up to Memphis,and alerts the cops that Swagger stole an FBI car. Now everyone is searching for Swagger,and he drives into a car wash to hide from the helicopters. While his car is being washed,Swagger hops in the back seat and cuts a hole to the trunk,where he grabs a medic kit and tends to his wounds. Speeding out of the car wash he is seen again by the cops and a chase ensues. The back end of his car is smashed by a truck,causing him to spin around and Swagger finds himself directly in front of a line of police officers. Throwing the car into reverse as the cops open fire on him,Swagger drives through a construction site and directly into the Delaware River. The cops find the car,but no Swagger. He is pulled alongside a boat,and makes it underneath a bridge. From there,he hot-wires a truck and takes off. Meanwhile,FBI agents watch a news report of the assassination attempt and of Swaggers escape. They all are not happy that Swagger overpowered Memphis so easily,even though Swagger is highly trained and Memphis is three weeks out of the academy. While meeting with his superior officer and other agents,Memphis tells them what Swagger said to him,but they all say that he didnt hear anything. Memphis will be put up for review. Swagger drives to a store and knocks out the power,then goes inside and buys supplies. Swagger drives to an empty car repair station and makes an IV for himself using the supplies.Swagger drives all night to Kentucky,where he goes to Sarahs home. Shes startled by him coming by,since shes seen the news about what happened. Sarah lets him come inside,and he apologizes for not coming to meet her after Donny died. She did receive his letter though,along with flowers each year on the anniversary of Donny&apos;s death. Swagger gives Sarah a list of things to get,and sends her out to get them. She eventually buys everything,and he quickly instructs her how to treat his bullet wounds before passing out. Even though shes not a nurse,she does a decent job of cleaning him up. Meanwhile,Memphis looks further into the assassination attempt and discusses it with FBI agent Alourdes Galindo (Rhona Mitra),who tells him to stop looking into it. The facts don&apos;t add up though,since there are several discrepancies with the news and Timmons story. He wants to talk with Timmons about it,but it turns out he was murdered the previous night in a &quot;botched burglary&quot;. Memphis goes to all of the locations that Swagger went to,and goes to the church tower where he sees specific markings in the dust. Hes convinced that Swagger isnt the guy they should be after,since he would not have missed the president and hit the Ethiopian Arch Bishop. Memphis also goes online to a gun chat room,where he finds out exactly what kind of gun was used in the assassination attempt. During this time,he begins to notice that people are watching him.Swagger eventually gets better,and tells Sarah that hes going to go after the guys who set him up. Sarah informs him that news reports are saying that Swagger killed his dog and tried to kill the president,with pictures released of him scouting out each location. Swagger is pissed that they killed his dog and plans to see this through to the end. He blames himself for Donny&apos;s death,but Sarah slaps him in the face and tells him that Donny fully knew what he got into. Sarah gives Swagger Donny&apos;s first sniper rifle and volunteers to help him. Their first course of action is to find Memphis. Sarah wears a disguise and meets Memphis in a public place,handing him the photographs of Johnson&apos;s license plate. Swagger watches across the street,but is seen by police who think that hes suspicious. Two cops approach him,one with an attack dog. After Sarah and Memphis leave,Swagger throws coffee into a cops face and makes the dog attack the cop. He then throws the cop and dog through a window while beating the crap out of the other police officer. He ditches his jacket and walks away. Memphis sneaks into a restricted area of the FBI office and tries to find information about the license plate number,but hes blocked out and requires a delta level clearance. Galindo tells him that hes going to be fired if he keeps looking into this,and starts to notice the faults as well in the facts of the Philadelphia shooting. She winds up telling him how to get the security clearance though. Dobbler informs Johnson about the internet chat room,and someone trying to access delta level security information. They realize that Memphis is looking where he shouldn&apos;t,and plan to take him out.As Memphis is walking on a bridge,he is abducted by masked men in a van. Memphis is severely beaten,and the men put him in a rig that will make him shoot himself. Swagger shoots each man one by one using Donny&apos;s rifle,and frees Memphis,who knows that Swagger was set up and agrees to help him. Johnson hears that Memphis didnt die and knows that hes now working with Swagger. He orders his men to look deep into Swaggers past. Memphis drives them to Tennessee,where they visit an old humorous marksman expert. Swagger asks the expert who could make a shot beyond a mile thats still alive. Apart from Swagger,there&apos;s one man. The sniper used to be sadistic,just shooting to wound and killing everyone who tried to help the wounded. He must have killed hundreds of people. He was in a building that was destroyed,and some believed him to be dead. The sniper is Michael Sandor,the handicapped Russian thats working with Johnson. Johnson knows that Swagger is going to look for the shooter,and so lets Sandor act as bait to lure Swagger out. Dobbler found that Swagger has sent flowers to Sarah each year,and believes that she helped him. Johnson orders them to get her.Swagger and Memphis go to a big hardware store and buy lots of supplies. They then drive out to the woods where they make napalm,pipe-bombs,and gas bombs. Swagger teaches Memphis to use a sniper rifle,and makes him practice while he sets off bombs nearby. Meanwhile,Sarah thinks that someones in her house and takes out her shotgun. A henchman appears with a silenced pistol,but is blasted through the chest by Sarah. Payne sneaks up behind Sarah and makes her put down the shotgun. He asks her where Swagger is,and beats her up. Its heavily implied that Payne rapes Sarah. Elsewhere,Johnson meets with corrupt senator Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty) and gets his approval to fly in over twenty soldiers to kill Swagger.Swagger and Memphis find where Sandor is,and plan an attack. Memphis remains in position near the forest while Swagger moves closer to the cabin. He sneaks up behind a guard and stabs him in the back,then sets up some bombs. He stabs another guard through the chin,and again places more bombs. Swagger makes quick work of the third guard,and shoots the fourth in the head. Sandor is all alone now,and reveals to Swagger what really happened. The president was never in any danger their only target that day was the Ethiopian Arch Bishop,because he was going to talk about Americans committing genocide to build an oil pipeline (approved by our government,since nothing happens without their approval). The best way to kill the Arch Bishop was to make it look like a failed attempt on the president. Swagger unwittingly was part of the genocide,since back in Ethiopia Donny and him were covering the soldiers that murdered the villagers. Swagger asks about Johnson,but Sandor doesn&apos;t know what his real name is,though he does know that he works for Meachum. Soldiers surround the cabin,and Memphis warns Swagger. Sandor pulls out a pistol and shoots himself in the head. Swagger orders Memphis to set off the pipe-bombs,and then the gas bombs. Two soldiers come into the house,and Swagger shoots both dead. Memphis sets off the bombs,and Swagger shoots his way out of the cabin. Memphis covers Swagger,and a big shootout ensues. Swagger makes it to Memphis,and a helicopter shows up to kill them. Swagger thinks back to Donny&apos;s death,and fires upon the helicopter. Both men run a safe distance and set off the napalm bombs,blowing up the remaining soldiers and destroying the helicopter. The incident is covered up though,since all the bodies were removed before the authorities showed up.Memphis calls the FBI field office and talks to his superior officer,informing him that he has Swagger in custody. He talks long enough for them to trace the call. Swagger then calls Johnson,who tells him that he wants to meet. Johnson reveals that he has Sarah,and Swagger reveals that he recorded Sandor&apos;s confession about everything. Johnson agrees to meet,but wants to see him coming from a long way off. Swagger requests that Meachum be present. The meeting is in the snowy mountains where Johnson,Meachum,Payne,and Sarah are present. Payne rigged a shotgun to his hand and is holding Sarah at gunpoint. They see Swagger walking towards them in the distance,and he is immediately shot in the chest by a hidden sniper. Johnson and Meachum are pleased,but their hidden snipers are shot through the head one by one. Turns out Swagger was posing as a hidden sniper while Memphis was walking towards Johnson. Memphis pulls out his armor and continues to walk towards them. Swagger aims carefully,and destroys Payne&apos;s shotgun while blowing off his thumb. Payne laughs in shock,and then Swagger blows off his arm. Memphis disarms Johnson and Meachum,and Swagger finally approaches them. Sarah grabs a pistol and shoots Payne to death. Meachum offers Swagger a job,but he refuses. Memphis calls in the FBI to come to their location,and Swagger burns Sandor&apos;s recording. Memphis tells him that it proves he&apos;s innocent,but Swagger knows that whoever turns over the recording is dead. No one there is innocent,and so they wait for the FBI to show up.Some time passes,and Swagger is brought to a meeting in the Department of Justice. Present are the Attorney General,Johnson,Memphis,and Sarah. Memphis shakes Swaggers hand and slips him unseen by others in the room. In front of him is his sniper rifle,and Swagger&apos;s hands are freed. He asks if the rifle has been tampered with by the FBI or any other authority,but it hasn&apos;t. He turns to Memphis,asking whether he believes in Swagger&apos;s innocence whether he trusts him with his life. Memphis answers yes,and Swagger loads a bullet into the rifle,aims at Memphis,and pulls the trigger to a resounding &quot;click&quot;,as nothing happens. The truth of the situation is clear: before he left to scout locations,he removed the firing pins from all his weapons (including the rifle in front of him that was supposedly used in the shooting). It was impossible,then,that he had used his weapon to kill the Ethiopian Archbishop. Clearly innocent,Swagger and Memphis then argue that the real guilty parties in the room is Johnson,tying him to the mass grave in Ethiopia. But the Attorney General has no jurisdiction over crimes Johnson may or may not have committed in other countries. Johnson is allowed to leave,telling Swagger that he had won again. The Attorney General frees Swagger,convinced that he&apos;s innocent.Some time later,Johnson celebrates his victory with Meachum and Dobbler in a remote cabin. Meachum and Johnson laugh about winning again,and Meachum plans to move Johnson out of the country to fix another problem they have. As Dobbler begins to explain his next mission,blood splatters on his face. A dead guard falls down directly in front of him. Johnson realizes that Swagger is there,but is shot through the chest. He dies very painfully. Dobbler turns off the lights,and Meachum orders him to get the car. Meachum&apos;s SUV explodes,and the men panic. Swagger moves underneath the cabin,and Dobbler tells the remaining bodyguard that Swagger is under the floor. Swagger shoots Dobbler through the knee from under the floor,and shoots the guard to death from below. He then enters the cabin,where Dobbler pleads with Swagger to spare his life since he didn&apos;t do anything. Swagger shoots Dobbler in the chest and approaches Meachum. &quot;I&apos;m a Senator: You can&apos;t do this!&quot; cries Dobbler,as Swagger blows his brains out with a pistol,before placing it in Johnsons hands. Swagger breaks the gas line of the cabin,and as Swagger runs to his car,the cabin explodes. The film ends with Swagger,Sarah behind the wheel,driving into the distance.</Plot>

The moment his zeppelin docks in New York,Dr. Vargas (Julian Curry) sends a pair of bullet-like metal vials to Dr. Jennings,another scientist; within moments,Dr. Vargas is gone and his name is crossed off a list.Dr. Jennings (Trevor Baxter) arranges to meet reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) during a showing of The Wizard of Oz at Radio City Music Hall. They discuss the disappearance of the world&apos;s top scientists,and he reveals that he knows who will be next: himself. He hints that he and the missing men have a connection,and whispers the name of the man behind the disappearances: Totenkopf. (Totenkopf is German for death&apos;s head.) Jennings drops a blueprint,which Polly picks up.Polly&apos;s return to the office is sidetracked when New York is invaded by flying robots that shoot laser rays out of their heads and crush people and property under their enormous feet. The overwhelmed military broadcasts a call for help to someone called Sky Captain. As Polly runs along the streets photographing the robots and gathering information for a story,Sky Captain (Jude Law),a.k.a. Joe Sullivan,appears in his Warhawk airplane,which is equipped with amazing high-tech modifications,to fight the monsters. He trips up several robots and the rest are driven off. Joe has one of the downed mechas taken to a base near New York,home of his mercenary air force,and turns it over to his gum-chewing technical expert Dex (Giovanni Ribisi). Polly follows and surprises Joe in his office. Polly and Joe have a back-story; they were an item some years before in Nanjing,but split up amid suspicions on her part that he was cheating and on his that she sabotaged his plane. Polly uses Dr. Jennings&apos; blueprint,which turns out to be a plan for the killer robots,as leverage to convince Joe to work with her -- and let her ride along when he goes after the robots.First Polly and Joe go to see Dr. Jennings in his laboratory,but they arrive too late. He&apos;s been attacked by a mysterious woman in black (Bai Ling),who escapes from Joe while Polly speaks to the dying scientist. Jennings gives her the two metal vials he received from Dr. Vargas and says that if Totenkopf acquires them,he&apos;ll destroy the world. He dies before he can explain.Back at Joe&apos;s base,the robots attack again. Joe,following Polly&apos;s directions,leads them on a nearly street-level flying chase through Manhattan while Dex tries to trace the source of the robots&apos; control signal. Joe throws off the pursuing robots by diving his plane into the ocean. Polly&apos;s sure they&apos;re going to die,but the plane can function as a submarine so they&apos;re able to resurface and fly back to base. They arrive in time to exchange fire with a departing squad of robots lead by the mysterious woman in black. The robots have taken Dex,but a brief search reveals that Dex left a clue. Stuck to a downed girder with bubblegum is a scrap of map on which he marked the source of the control signal: a remote valley in the Himalayas. Joe and Polly take off immediately to get Dex back.In Nepal Kaji (Omid Djalili),a contact of Joe&apos;s,reluctantly agrees to take them to the valley of Shambala. He notes that in Hebrew it&apos;s called Eden,&quot;and you may know it as Shangri-la.&quot; A trek through the snowy mountains with Kaji and a couple of guides brings them to an old mine,where the guides trap Polly and Joe in a vault rigged with dynamite and make off with the metal vials,which Polly had never mentioned to Joe. Kaji finds them and lets them out in time to save their lives,but not Polly&apos;s extra film. (She has only two shots left in her camera and spends the rest of the movie agonizing over how to use them.) The explosion knocks them out and the three of them wake up naked in a large,richly appointed bed. A Nepalese monk comes in and tells them (via Kaji) that they are in Shangri-la. He agrees to help them when they say that they&apos;re after Dr. Totenkopf. Totenkopf had forced the people of Shangri-la to work in the &quot;poisoned mine&quot; -- a uranium mine -- and all but one of the miners have died. They ask to speak with the survivor,who gives them a cane that he says will guide them to Totenkopf&apos;s base. In return for this favor,the horribly disfigured miner asks them to kill him.Back in the plane,Joe and Polly use the inscriptions on the cane to plot a course to Totenkopf&apos;s location,which Joe marks with an X on the map. Then he makes another X,somewhat closer to them than the first. &quot;What&apos;s that point there?&quot; asks Polly. &quot;That&apos;s where we run out of fuel,&quot; Joe replies. Joe radios a message to his old friend Franky,who commands a secret British airborne air base where he hopes they can refuel. Shortly after the plane&apos;s tank runs dry and they begin a gliding descent,the air base materializes out of the clouds and they&apos;re able to land safely.Franky turns out to be Commander Francesca Cook (Angelina Jolie),who Polly realizes must be Joe&apos;s other woman when Franky mentions Nanjing. She leads her amphibious squadron to escort Joe and Polly to the island they&apos;ve identified as Totenkopf&apos;s hideout. Franky and her squadron distract the robot guardian of the hideout&apos;s underwater entrance so that Joe&apos;s plane can slip through. As they disembark,Polly sees the registration number on the fuselage reflected in the water: h-110d,inverted,reads &quot;polly.&quot; She doesn&apos;t say anything to Joe.In the island&apos;s huge underground base,a spaceship is being loaded with animals. (Joe is astonished that Polly doesn&apos;t find this spectacle worthy of her last remaining frame of film.) Dex turns up in a kind of flying flat-bed truck to rescue Joe and Polly from some of Totenkopf&apos;s robots. Dex has also rescued several of the scientists who disappeared. They tell Polly and Joe that the spaceship is meant to give life a fresh start on a new world that Totenkopf calls the World of Tomorrow. In addition to the animals,the ship will carry the mysterious vials,which contain genetic material for a new,improved human race -- Totenkopf&apos;s Adam and Eve. However,after the ship takes off its booster rocket will destroy the Earth.The group locates Totenkopf&apos;s quarters,but they&apos;re booby-trapped,and one of the scientists is electrocuted trying to get in. The booby-trap triggers a projection of the head of Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier),a la the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz. Totenkopf condemns &quot;a world consumed by hatred and bent on self-destruction.&quot; He concludes,&quot;I am the last desperate chance for a doomed planet. Now,leave this place or die!&quot;Dex disables the booby-trap and the party enters the villain&apos;s study to find Totenkopf&apos;s dessicated,long-dead corpse clutching a note that says &quot;Forgive me.&quot; Joe,deciding that he&apos;ll have to board the spaceship to stop it,first socks Polly in the jaw -- if she&apos;s unconscious,she can&apos;t insist on coming along and she&apos;ll be safe. As he attempts to get inside the ship,he&apos;s attacked by the woman in black,who turns out to be a robot. Polly turns up to save him,and gives him a sock in the jaw for good measure.Joe and Polly go aboard and cross a narrow bridge over the deep,hollow core of the ship to reach the controls. The rocket takes off and begins a countdown toward the release of the booster stage,which will destroy the planet. As Joe and Polly struggle to turn off the booster,the robot in black attacks again. Joe fends her off and uses her raygun to disable the booster. He and Polly get away in an escape pod just before the rocket blows up without harming the Earth. They land in the water,surrounded by pods containing animals from Totenkopf&apos;s space-ark,which Polly released before they disabled the booster. Polly pans around in search of an image for her final photograph and finally settles on Joe. After she snaps the shutter,he looks disturbed. Polly: &quot;You don&apos;t have to say anything.&quot; Joe: &quot;Lens cap.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>A man (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train sitting across from a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). The woman seems to know him by the name Sean Fentress,but he doesn&apos;t seem to know her and appears uncertain of his own identity. After eight minutes,a bomb goes off on the train,and the man awakens to find himself strapped inside a small geodesic dome. There,Air Force Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains to him through a computer screen that he is actually Colter Stevens,a decorated army helicopter pilot,now on a mission to locate the maker of a bomb which destroyed a train headed into Chicago. This is to be accomplished using the Source Code,a time loop program that allows him to take over someone&apos;s body in a reenactment of their last eight minutes of life.Stevens has no memory of how he became involved in the Source Code project; his last memory is of flying in a recent mission in Afghanistan while taking on enemy gunfire. Stevens&apos; mission in the Source Code is to assume the identity of Fentress,one of the train&apos;s passengers,locate the bomb,discover who detonated it,and report back to Goodwin to prevent the bomber from detonating a larger dirty nuclear device in downtown Chicago,which could cause the deaths of millions of people. Goodwin and the Source Code&apos;s creator,Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright),tell him that the Source Code is not a simulation,but a visit into the past in the form of an alternate reality. He&apos;s told that he cannot truly alter the past to save any of the passengers,but that he must gather intel that can be used to alter the future and prevent a future attack. Goodwin assures Stevens that &quot;everything will be OK.&quot;Stevens is sent into the Source Code repeatedly,and each time a series of events repeat,with variations due to Stevens&apos; acts. Meanwhile,he goes on searching for the terrorist and getting to know Christina,until the bomb that destroys the train goes off and Fentress dies,sending Stevens back to the chamber.Even though Rutledge and Goodwin constantly direct him to focus on finding the bomber,each time around he learns more,both about the terrorist attack and his real life personal situation. Stevens resolves to complete his mission,now with the added personal goal of saving Christina and the people on the train if at all possible.Using a cellphone while on the train,Stevens eventually discovers that he supposedly died two months ago. He confronts Goodwin with this information,and learns from Goodwin and Rutledge that he had been shot down during the war,and his mutilated body was appropriated by the Air Force and used by Rutledge to operate the Source Code. Stevens then asks Rutledge and Goodwin to let him die,which they promise they will do once the mission is finished.He eventually discovers that the bomber is a disturbed American young man named Derek Frost (Michael Arden),which allows authorities to apprehend Frost and save Chicago before the second bomb is detonated.With the mission accomplished,and despite their promise,Rutledge orders Stevens&apos; memory to be erased and stored for reuse in further missions. However,Stevens persuades Goodwin to send him in one more time and give him one last chance to avert the train disaster. Goodwin agrees that he deserves to be allowed to die in peace afterwards instead of being held alive as a military brain in a vat.With the information he has uncovered from previous trips into the Source Code,Stevens is able to defuse the bomb and immobilize Frost before he can destroy the train.Stevens and Christina kiss in the last seconds before the eight-minute mark. In that instant,Goodwin turns off his life support per his request,but to Stevens&apos; surprise,his mind remains in Sean Fentress&apos; body. He is then able to safely leave the train with Christina,also saving the rest of the passengers. Now in the alternate universe,an alternate version of Goodwin receives an email from Stevens explaining what has happened and that the Source Code can alter the target alternate reality. The movie ends with Stevens taking Fentress&apos; place,and asking Goodwin to help Captain Colter Stevens and tell him that &quot;everything will be OK.&quot;,which Goodwin had told Stevens earlier in the film.</Plot>

        <Plot>Months after the events of Spider-Man 2,Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) attends the opening night of Mary-Jane Watson&apos;s (Kirsten Dunst) new Broadway show,Manhattan Memories. Also attending is Harry Osborn (James Franco) who recently found out about Peter&apos;s secret identity and has accused him of murdering his father,Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe),who was also the menacing villain,the Green Goblin.As Peter leaves the show,he sees Harry,and runs up to him. He asks Harry to hear his side of the story,but Harry rejects him and leaves. Once home,Harry is seen stepping out of a gas chamber,his muscles considerably larger and with a look of confidence on his face. Peter goes backstage and catches up with MJ,before the two go to a park. Peter spins them a hammock with his spider powers,and the two lay in it,stargazing. As the couple leans in for a kiss,behind them a meteor falls nearby. Unknown to them,a strange,black substance crawls out of the meteor,attaching itself to Peter&apos;s moped as he and MJ leave.Meanwhile,Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church),an escaped convict,climbs through his sick daughter&apos;s bedroom window and watches her sleep with machines attached to help her breathe. After a few minutes,he goes into the kitchen to find some food,but is caught by his wife,Emma. He tries to tell her that he was wrongly accused for the apparent murder of a man,but Emma shouts at him and his daughter opens her bedroom door; she hands Marko a small locket with her picture in it,and Marko promises that he will find the money to make her better again,somehow,but Emma shouts at him and tells him to get out. He does so.Peter arrives at his Aunt May&apos;s (Rosemary Harris) apartment and tells her that he is planning to propose to MJ. May tells him that he needs to put her before himself,and he convinces himself that he can do it. May then tells him the story of how Peter&apos;s Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) proposed to her. When she is finished,she tells Peter to make the proposal very special to Mary Jane,and hands him her wedding ring as a gift for MJ.Driving back to his apartment,Peter is whisked off his moped by a masked figure on some sort of hoverboard. The masked figure throws Peter into a wall,and then reveals himself as Harry,or the New Goblin. Peter and Harry fight through the streets of New York,and the end result is Harry getting knocked out in an alleyway. Peter takes him to a hospital and watches as they try and revive Harry.At the same time,Flint Marko is running from the cops through the marshlands (fenced test facility). He climbs a security fence,and then falls into a concrete pit,landing on a pile of sand at the bottom. The pit is revealed to be a particle accelerator,and Flint is caught inside it as research tests are begun. When the police finally reach the accelerator,Marko is nowhere to be seen amongst the sand - he appears to have deteriorated into the sand.Peter is told that Harry will be okay,and is led into the ward where Harry lies. Harry has lost his memory,and so he and Peter begin to get along just like the old days. Mary Jane arrives and then she and Peter are asked to leave; Harry tells the nurse that he would give his life for his two best friends.The pile of sand in the particle accelerator stirs later that morning,and a humanoid shape rises out of the sand. It is Flint Marko,transformed into the Sandman. He sees a small glitter in the sand,and realises that it is the locket that Penny gave him. He picks it up and attempts to stand,willed by his love for his daughter. He regains his human appearance,and starts learning how to walk again.Back at Peter&apos;s apartment,Peter is admiring the ring he is planning to give to MJ when she knocks on his door. He lets her in and she enters,flustered. She reads out a rather negative review of her performance in the play from the previous night; Peter uses his experiences as Spider-Man to try and comfort her,but MJ gets even more upset.Just when she thinks Peter is about to understand,Peter&apos;s illegal police band monitor goes off and reports about an out-of-control crane in midtown. Peter gives MJ a sympathetic look and then changes into his costume,swinging off through the city. MJ pauses as she leaves,startled by a small bang,but dismisses it almost instantly. What she doesn&apos;t see is the meteoric black substance crawling down the back of Peter&apos;s desk and into the shadows of the closet...In midtown,across the road from and completely unaware of the out-of-control crane,Peter&apos;s lab partner in science,Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard),is having a photoshoot in an office building. A rebar slams through the windows behind her,and then drops down another floor and smashes out the floor supports below. The corner of the building drops,and Gwen slides down to the edge of the building and hangs on with all her might.&#x0A;Just as she falls,Spider-Man swings in and catches her,and sets her down. Spider-Man is approached by Eddie Brock (Topher Grace),Gwen&apos;s alleged boyfriend,who tells Spidey that he is the new photographer of Spider-Man. Spider-Man swings off,annoyed with this new photographer,and then goes to the Daily Bugle to deliver the editor some photos of the crane accident. When he arrives,it turns out that Brock has gotten there first,and J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) chooses Brock&apos;s photo over Peter&apos;s.Brock explains that he would like a staff job,and Jameson tells the two photographers that if either of them wants the staff job then they will have to get a picture of Spider-Man committing a crime. Peter tells Brock that he doesn&apos;t have a chance at getting the photo,and Peter goes to Times Square. There,he sees a sign saying Spider-Man is to receive the Key to the City. Peter then goes to take Harry back to his penthouse apartment and the two hang out there. Peter gives Harry his old basketball,and throws it to him in the living room. It knocks into a vase and knocks the vase off and Harry effortlessly catches both the ball and the vase. He marvels at his skill,worrying Peter.Mary Jane goes to the theatre to attend a rehearsal session,but discovers that after several bad critic reviews she has been fired from the show and replaced. She leaves the theatre,and is startled when she meets a round of applausefrom the crowd,but is disheartened as Spider-Man swings by and she realizes the applause is actually for him. She storms off,frustrated and upset.The next day,Peter attends the ceremony being held for Spider-Man. He meets MJ,who doesn&apos;t tell him about her being fired from the show. She encourages him,and then he walks off. Harry arrives,and he offers to attend her play that night. She tells him that she&apos;s been kicked off,and then wonders to herself why she told Harry rather than Peter.Gwen Stacy introduces Spider-Man as the person who saved her from certain death,and then Spider-Man swings in,performing small stunts on the stage. He drops down and suspends himself at head level with Gwen Stacy,upside down. He tells her to kiss him,for publicity,and she does so in a kiss reminiscent of the one Peter and MJ shared in the alleyway.Suddenly,a cloud of sand flies in,and the ceremony is disrupted. Spider-Man swings off to find out what is going on,and sees the cloud of dust form a person who breaks into an armoured car. Spidey lands in the car and tries to punch the Sandman,but his arm goes straight through his stomach. Sandman punches Spider-Man out of the vehicle,and Spidey swings back in to try and fight off the Sandman. Sandman runs off as Spider-Man realises that the armoured car is about to crash into a large vehicle,and manages to save the two drivers. He jumps out,with Sandman nowhere in sight.The following night,Peter goes to a fancy French restaurant and gives the Maitre d&apos; the ring for Mary Jane for safekeeping. He sits and waits for MJ,practising his proposal. As MJ arrives,Gwen Stacy also approaches,and Peter introduces her to MJ as his lab partner. This infuriates MJ,and Gwen quickly leaves. MJ asks Peter if he&apos;s trying to push her away,inappropriately kissing another girl with &quot;their&quot; kiss,but leaves when he replies. Peter tries to follow her,but gives up and retrieves the ring.The following morning,Peter tries to contact Mary Jane,but she deliberately doesn&apos;t answer the phone. As he hangs up,the phone rings,and he picks it up. A Detective asks him to go down to the police station,where Peter and Aunt May are informed by Captain Stacy (Gwen Stacy&apos;s father) that the police got the facts wrong surrounding Uncle Ben&apos;s death,and that he was actually murdered by someone else. The cop pulls out a picture of Flint Marko,and Peter instantly recognises him. He storms back home,waiting for any news on Sandman.MJ arrives while he waits,and tells him she wants to support him through this. He tells her he doesn&apos;t need help,and she tries to make him understand that everybody needs help at some point in their lives,even Spider-Man. She leaves,and Peter continues waiting for the police band to give him some news about Sandman... as he waits,he falls asleep.Silently,the black meteoric substance approaches him,and he wakes up hanging upside down in front of a skyscraper window. His Spider-Man suit is now jet black,and has enhanced his powers,making him feel really good. He swings around the city and then visits Curtis Connors (Dylan Baker),his science teacher,who agrees to analyse the black substance. Curtis warns him that the substance appears to be a symbiote,in need of a host to bind to; he warns Peter not to get any on him. Peter goes home and finally hears a report about Sandman on the police band. He puts on the black suit and goes to fight Sandman,with his powers enhanced. Brock turns up to photograph the event,but Spider-Man turns on him,ripping the camera away and smashing it. Spider-Man then goes on to fight and kill Sandman,ruthlessly drowning him and thereby transforming him into a pile of wet mud.Peter goes home and argues with the landlord,Mr. Ditkovich,and then slams his door on him. The landlord retreats back to his room,shocked at Peter&apos;s sudden outburst. Peter,meanwhile,looks in the mirror and realises that the black suit is altering his personality,and so takes it off. He then visits Aunt May,telling her of Marko&apos;s death at the hands of Spider-Man. She is shocked that Spider-Man could act like that,and tells Peter that revenge can take people over,like a poison,and change them.MJ walks through New York,feeling lonely,and calls up Harry. She visits him,and together they make an omelette,singing and dancing to Chubby Checker&apos;s The Twist. After eating,MJ reads from a play that Harry wrote for her,and then the two kiss. Realising that she actually doesn&apos;t feel anything for Harry,she leaves,much to the dismay of the equally lonely Harry. He suddenly has flashbacks and remembers Peter&apos;s alter-ego; he sees his father in the mirror telling him to attack Peter&apos;s heart.Mary Jane arrives home and hears Peter leaving a message on her answering machine. As he finishes,she is thrown against the wall by the New Goblin,who was lurking in the shadows. With his mask off,he tells MJ there is something she must do for him if she wants Peter to live.Mary Jane calls Peter and asks him to meet her in Central Park,where she dumps him,claiming to be in love with another man. Peter then meets Harry in a diner,where Harry claims that he is the other man. Peter furiously leaves and puts the black suit on,arriving back at Harry&apos;s apartment that night. He furiously attacks Harry,knocking him into a glass shelf and then sneering at Harry that his father had never loved him. Harry throws a bomb at Peter,but Peter snags it with a web and throws it back at him. Peter leaves as the bomb goes off.The next day,Peter strolls through the streets and sees an article about Spider-Man stealing some money from the bank,photo courtesy of Eddie Brock. He recognises the photo as an altered version of one that he took himself years ago. He goes to the Daily Bugle and alerts Jameson to the fraud,who fires Brock from his new position as Daily Bugle staff. The paper has to issue its first retraction in 20 years,which infuriates Jameson.Peter then struts through the streets with an air of confidence,looking at several girls suggestively and clicking his fingers. As a montage,we see Peter on the phone with Dr. Connors,who tells Peter that the black substance,a symbiote,will amplify the characteristics of its host,especially aggression. Peter brushes it off and then we see him in the Daily Bugle,in a tight embrace with Betty Brant,Jameson&apos;s secretary. Jameson walks in and the two break apart; Jameson&apos;s assistant,Robbie,picks up some photos of black-suited Spider-Man that Peter placed on Jameson&apos;s desk. Jameson offers Peter the usual rate,but Peter says that if he wants the pictures,Jameson has to give him the staff job.As the last part of the montage,Peter struts into a shop,walking out in a new black jacket and suit,and does a small dance in the middle of the street before finally strutting off.That evening,some mud falls out of a sewer pipe and into a small pond; it reforms,and Sandman crawls out of the water. Strung around his hand is the locket,and he takes one look at it and then walks off,determined to live up to his promise.Peter takes Gwen to a jazz club where MJ is now working,in an effort to make MJ jealous. When MJ gets up to sing,Peter jumps up and starts playing the piano with the band,leaving MJ speechless. He suddenly jumps up and launches into a full dance routine throughout the jazz club,ultimately resulting in Gwen realising that he did it all to make MJ jealous. She leaves the jazz club,and Peter attempts to talk to MJ. The bouncer tries to throw Peter out,but Peter starts viciously beating him up; when MJ tries to step in,he turns around and smacks her hard on the jaw,sending her flying to the ground. She asks him who he is,and he accepts that he doesn&apos;t know. He leaves,MJ still lying on the floor with a look of shock on her face.Peter dons his full black Spider-Man costume and swings up to the top of a church tower,where he jumps down and begins tearing at the costume by the church bell. The bell sound seems to pain the symbiote,and it eventually comes off clean.At the same time,Eddie Brock is sitting in the church praying for God to kill Peter. He hears the bells ringing and goes to investigate,and is caught as the symbiote drips off Peter and lands on him. The symbiote changes Brock into Venom,a terrifying variation of Spider-Man with huge teeth and claws.Peter is visited that night by his Aunt May,who tells him that despite everything that he might have done to Mary Jane,he can make things right somehow. He watches as she leaves,feeling comforted.Venom swings through the streets of Manhattan when he is suddenly stopped by Flint Marko,who mistakes him for Spider-Man. Venom tells Marko that together,they could defeat Spider-Man,and Marko agrees to team-up. Venom gets a taxicab,then drives up to MJ&apos;s house and collects her when she flags him down to get to the Jazz Club. He kidnaps her and hangs her high in the taxicab in a web,suspended 80 stories above the ground in an under-construction skyscraper. Peter sees reports of the kidnapping on the news,and then changes into his Spider-Man costume.He goes to Harry&apos;s apartment and asks for help,but Harry rejects him again and turns to show Peter the scar on his face. Peter tries once more to get Harry&apos;s help,for Mary Jane&apos;s sake,but Harry merely growls at him to get out. Peter leaves,and Harry is confronted by the house butler,Bernard,who tells Harry that he cleaned his father&apos;s wound the night he died. He tells Harry that the blade that pierced his father&apos;s body came from his own glider.Spider-Man swings into the construction site and lands on the front of the car; Venom swings in and knocks him through the windshield. He grabs the back of the car and hauls himself up,and Venom knocks him down again. He lands down on the web and then Venom jumps on him. Peter tries to ask Brock to settle the problem some other way,but Venom declines. Peter and Venom topple out of the web and have a midair fight before Peter hits the ground. He is then tripped up as Sandman appears,more than ten times his normal size and growling like a monster. Spider-Man attempts to escape Sandman,but Venom knocks him onto a steel bar and holds him there with his webbing. Sandman pummels him with his gigantic fist while onlookers begin to weep.Just before Sandman can finish Spider-Man off,Harry flies in and throws a bomb at Sandman,and helps Peter up. The two fight Sandman and Venom,and Harry eventually knocks Sandman down while Peter gets MJ out of the taxi and into a safer area. Venom then attacks Peter,and traps him with his webbing,but Harry flies in and attempts to stab Venom with some blades protruding out the front of his hoverboard. Venom grabs his board and flings him off,knocking several rebars loose and collapsing to the floor. The clanging sound pains the symbiote,and Peter remembers back to the bell noise in the church.Venom leaps towards Peter with Harry&apos;s board,intending to impale Peter,but Harry runs in between Venom and Peter,and is himself impaled instead. Venom throws him aside and then leaps towards Peter again,who manages to snap his wrists free and smack Venom around the head with a rebar. Peter circles Venom with the bars,and the clanging sound pains Venom as each one is slammed into the ground. Peter snags Eddie from inside the suit with his webbing and pulls him out; he then throws a bomb from Harry&apos;s glider at the symbiote. Eddie rushes towards the symbiote while the bomb flies through the air,and is killed in the resulting explosion.Sandman approaches Peter and tells him that the killing of Uncle Ben was,in fact,an accident caused by his gun going off. Peter forgives him and Sandman flies off through the buildings while Peter swings down to Harry. He and MJ sit on either side of him,comforting him while he dies. Harry forgives Peter for the death of his father and then dies as the sun rises.Peter,MJ,Gwen,Aunt May and several others attend Harry&apos;s funeral,and then we fade into MJ singing at the jazz club. She stops singing as Peter walks in,and then he steps forwards,his hand outstretched. She takes it and the two embrace,slowly dancing on the spot to the music of the jazz band.THE ENDWritten by joel-waroftheworlds,03.02.08</Plot>

        <Plot>Screenwriter John Fusco returns to the Western themes of his previous films Young Guns and Thunderheart with this animated children&apos;s adventure from Dreamworks. Matt Damon supplies the voice of Spirit, a wild Mustang stallion living free in the Old West of the late 19th century, where he&apos;s captured by human horse traders and sold to a cavalry regiment at a frontier outpost. There, a cruel colonel (voice of James Cromwell) nearly succeeds in breaking the willful horse, but not quite. Spirit escapes in the company of another captive, Little Creek (voice of Daniel Studi), a Native American youth that tries to possess the magnificent animal by more humane means, but Spirit refuses to bend to human will even when he makes the acquaintance of Little Creek&apos;s beautiful and fiercely loyal mare, Rain. After he saves Little Creek&apos;s life in an Army raid, Spirit believes that the gravely injured Rain has perished after a tumble over a waterfall. Despondent, the horse is captured again by humans, enslaved this time for work in a pack team on the transcontinental railroad. Undaunted by the tragedies that befall him, Spirit manages to escape for a reunion with Little Creek, Rain, and his long-lost brethren. Featuring songs by rock singer Bryan Adams, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron departs from other examples of its genre in that the horse protagonists do not speak or sing; only Spirit&apos;s voice is heard as voice-over narration.</Plot>

        <Plot>&quot;Sucker Punch&quot; is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place,she is free to go where her mind takes her,and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what&apos;s real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will,but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom,she urges four other young girls-the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish),the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone),the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung)-to band together and try to escape a terrible fate at the hands of their captors,Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino),before the mysterious High Roller (Jon Hamm) comes for Babydoll. Led by Babydoll,the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents,with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together,they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn),their unbelievable journey-if they succeed-will set them free.. -- (C) Warner Bros</Plot>

        <Plot>The crew of the Icarus II is sent into deep space to reignite the sun,after the failure of the first mission,Icarus I,seven years prior. It takes 16 months for them to get close to the sun,as mentioned in the introduction voice over by Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy). As the ship nears the sun,solar noise known as &quot;the [communications] dead zone&quot; begins to interfere with radio communications to Earth. As the ship encountered the &quot;Dead Zone&quot; seven days earlier than expected,the crew is now left with just 24 hours to collect all of their individual thoughts and send each of them off to their loved ones in a last message &quot;packet&quot;.Capa has difficulty in finding his words,and makes several different attempts at his message,accidentally &quot;running out the clock&quot; on fellow crew member Mace (Chris Evans). A fight breaks out between Capa and Mace,which lingers as open animosity between the two,despite Mace&apos;s apology. Icarus II&apos;s psychiatrist,Searle (Cliff Curtis) has Mace spend a couple of hours in the &quot;Earth&quot; room,which simulates sensual experiences on Earth. Afterward,Mace apologizes to Capa and they become civil toward each other.The ship has an oxygen garden to provide both food and carbon to atmosphere recycling during the trip. It is noted that while the ship is only about 2/3rds of the way to its destination [the sun],the garden has been producing oxygen at better than expected rates - the ship already has enough oxygen stored up for the delivery,and a quarter of the return trip.Searle (Cliff Curtis) has become fascinated at looking out from the ship&apos;s viewport at the approaching sun and is curious what it would be like to experience the unfiltered view. The Icarus&apos; computer (the voice of Chipo Chung) warns him that he can only tolerate 3.1% of the actual light,and Searle has Icarus set the system for 30 seconds of viewing at this 3.1% rate. The result has some kind of effect on Searle,who begins to spend many hours in the viewing room,repeating his exposures to the sun so often that his skin eventually peels away and sores cover his face.The ship&apos;s Captain,Kaneda,has been researching the Icarus I&apos;s logs in an attempt to discover what went wrong,and thereby prevent his crew from making the same errors.As the ship approaches Mercury,Harvey,the ship&apos;s communications officer,picks up a signal from the Icarus I&apos;s distress beacon,only hearing the faint signal because it was amplified by the iron in Mercury&apos;s mass. Emphasizing that some of those aboard Icarus I could still be alive,Captain Kaneda explains this point to the crew,and begins a discussion as to whether the current mission should be altered in order to check on the Icarus I&apos;s distress beacon. Mace is not happy with the choice to divert from their flight path because their mission has the utmost priority.Dr. Searle says that he agrees with Mace&apos;s assessment,but adds that diverting to the Icarus I could possibly add a second payload [bomb]. He argues that since the Icarus bombs have never existed before and therefore have never been actually detonated either,their existence is &quot;entirely theoretical&quot; and having two could be advantageous if something went wrong with the first one. There is further heated discussion,which Captain Kaneda finally stops by saying he is handing the decision to the ships most informed person in these matters,their nuclear physicist,Capa.Capa is troubled by being asked to make this decision. He explains to the captain that he simply doesn&apos;t have enough information to make an informed and rational decision,and the best he can do is to &quot;flip a coin&quot;. When Kaneda asks &quot;So? heads or tails&quot;,Capa replies &quot;Heads: two last best chances are better than one.&quot;Capa&apos;s decision is finalized by the captain: both Icarus crafts will rendezvous together. The ship&apos;s navigation officer Trey (Benedict Wong),plots the course,checks it three separate times,and is satisfied he has been accurate. Trey shifts the Icarus II&apos;s course to intercept the Icarus I. In the many calculations,Trey misses one - the need to readjust the heat shield that protects the ship from the sun&apos;s radiation. This error is discovered when there is an emergency declared by the computer after slight damage to the heat shield results from Trey&apos;s mistake.The true extent of the damage can only be assessed,and then repaired,by leaving the ship and working directly in space. Captain Kaneda asks for a volunteer to accompany him and,after refusing to allow the second in command to join him,Capa is volunteered by Mace - this is Mace&apos;s way of stating that the current events are a direct result of Capa&apos;s decision to alter the original mission,and the &quot;volunteering is clearly made in anger and not by deciding if Capa was the best man for the job.&quot; Nevertheless,Capa accepts the implicit challenge,and Kaneda agrees to let him accompany him on the spacewalk.As Capt Kaneda and Capa exit the ship in EVA suits to begin repairs,the ship&apos;s pilot,Cassie (Rose Byrne),moves the Icarus II&apos;s position so as to provide the two spacewalking astronauts as much &quot;shade&quot; as she can. She does this knowing it will result in the loss of the two communications towers needed to return to Earth later. The tips of the comm towers burn up as they continue to revolve around the living quarters,in and out of the sunlight. In consequence,Cassie unwittingly sets off another chain of events,when the still revolving and burning remnants of the communications tower causes a beam of sunlight to deflect towards the centre of the ship and onto the Oxygen Garden. This results in a fire that initially the ship copes with,but soon it flashes out of control and threatens not only the garden,but the entire ship itself.CorazÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³n (Michelle Yeoh) rushes to her rapidly burning garden and requests entry,thinking she can save it but Mace,weighing up the situation quickly,realizes that the mission and ship will be lost unless drastic action is taken so he orders the computer to release all the stored oxygen in the tanks,to provide such an enormous boost to the fire that it will literally &quot;blow itself out&quot;; however,knowing too that this will completely destroy the garden.During this event,the computer begins to take automatic control of the Icarus,in order to return the heat shield back to cover the living quarters as continued exposure threatens the mission (which due to Cassie is now protecting the two astronauts from being vaporized by mere direct exposure to the sun). Cassie realizes that this maneuver will result in the death of the two spacewalkers and she tries to countermand the order but the computer refuses to be ignored.Cassie and the computer fight over control for a few moments,with Cassie eventually using an override command that needs to be authorised by a second crew member. Cassie turns to Mace to have him say his authorisation code but he won&apos;t - he believes the mission far outweighs the loss of Kaneda and Capa. When Mace refuses to go along,Cassie pleads with the communications officer,Harvey (Troy Garity). Harvey immediately issues his authorisation.Silently disagreeing,Mace directly calls Captain Kaneda and asks him to support him,countermanding the orders just issued by Carrie and Harvey - a decision that will result in his own (Captain Kaneda&apos;s) death and of Capa. Kaneda agrees with Mace that the mission is more important than his and Capa&apos;s life and the Captain tells the computer to resume corrective shading and proceed with the mission,which it does.As the ship begins to lose cover for the two astronauts,Kaneda orders Capa to go back to the ship,as he patches the last of the heat shield damage by himself. Capa complies,and shortly after,Kaneda fixes the remaining damage,and then meets his demise with exposure to the sun.Because of the loss of their oxygen garden they now have no choice but to intercept Icarus I. Trey still blames himself and is put on suicide watch.Now alongside Icarus I,Searle,Capa,Mace,and Harvey board to discover that there is enough food to last; a flourishing oxygen garden and a workable payload. However,there has been extensive damage to the ship&apos;s computer servers which will not allow the ship to move. Additionally all crew members are found burned to death in the viewing room,the result of the filter being turned off. The comment is made that if the Icarus I were not behind the shield of Icarus II,those seeing the burned crew members would suffer the same fate.While the crew is investigating,the airlock connecting the Icarus I to the Icarus II is mysteriously destroyed and both ships are pulled apart. They find one EVA suit that would let Capa go back (as he is the only one able to deploy the payload) to Icarus II. Harvey disputes Capa being given the suit because of his status as Captain following Kaneda&apos;s death. Searle stays to manually open the shafts while Harvey and Mace use the insulation of the ship to cover themselves so they can hold onto Capa as he is shot towards the Icarus II and make it in themselves. During the actual trip,Capa loses his grip on Harvey whom falls out into outer space and is frozen.

She concludes there is enough for four of the five of them to live to the delivery of the payload. It is decided Mace will kill Trey but when he goes to carry out the act,he finds Trey has already appeared to have committed suicide. Mace very viciously smears blood on Capa&apos;s hand,blaming him for Trey&apos;s death and again the two fight,a battle that ends quickly in the low oxygen environment of the ship.In the payload room,Icarus II&apos;s computer tells Capa there is not enough oxygen for them to live until they deliver the payload. He says that Corazon did the math and himself,Corazon,Mace,and Cassie should have enough to last. He claims there are four crew members but the computer says there are five and one is unknown. Capa learns the location of the fifth on the ship and finds it is Captain Pinbacker (Mark Strong),who has survived from Icarus I. He is terribly burnt everywhere on his body and is clearly psychotic. Pinbacker reveals he sabotaged the first mission because he felt it defied the will of God. He slices a wound in Capa&apos;s chest with a stolen scalpel and chases him through the ship. Capa makes it to the EVA suit room and locks himself in. Pinbacker pulls the safety lever,trapping Capa in the room. Pinbacker then removes the ship&apos;s computer servers from their coolant just as he did on his own ship.In the burned out oxygen garden,Corazon finds a single seedling rapidly growing out of the newly burnt soil,giving her and the mission hope of not just survival but even returning to Earth. As she calls Capa and Cassie to the room,Pinbacker kills her. Mace goes into the cooling unit to fix the Icarus II&apos;s mainframe by immersing himself in the coolant. He is caught in the machine,his leg injured and bleeding and eventually freezing to death. Pinbacker also chases Cassie who hides in the front of the ship,in the nuclear payload.Trapped in EVA suit room,Capa talks to Mace before he dies. Mace,in agony from the freezing coolant,tells Capa he&apos;ll have to manually decouple the nuclear payload from Icarus and fly it directly into the sun. Capa escapes from the room by,donning an EVA suit,puncturing the inner door with a welding torch and releasing the outer airlock door. Much of the ship&apos;s loose contents and the body of Corazon,fly out of the ship and Capa gains access. He decouples the payload and walks to the front hatch of the ship. As the payload and Icarus II drift apart,Capa uses the propulsion unit of his EVA suit to fly to the payload. As he reaches it,the payload&apos;s thrusters fire,burning up part of Icarus II. The rest of the ship burns up and explodes.Capa goes into the payload to manually pilot and ignite it. There he finds Cassie hiding and is confronted by Pinbacker. The two grapple with the psychotic Pinbacker and escape his clutches. Capa manages to ignite the payload and as the nuclear reaction begins he finds peace,accepting his death and stares into the flames of the sun as it looms ever closer.Back on Earth,Robert Capa&apos;s sister (Paloma Baeza) and her children (Archie and Sylvie Macdonald) are outside in a park covered with snow as she watches the last message sent to her by Capa. A brighter than usual sun is seen finally breaking through the clouds over a frozen Sydney Harbour showing they succeeded in their mission.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film starts in February of 1979,at a steel plant in Lillian,Ohio. Elizabeth Lamb (Caitriona Balfe) has been killed in an accident. Though their family and friends are sad for her husband,Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler),their main concern is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney),Elizabeth and Jackson&apos;s son. Joe was more attached to his Mom than his Dad,who was never really been there for his son.Later at the Lamb&apos;s house,Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard) pays a visit. Jackson blames Louis for his wife&apos;s death,and forces him out of the house and puts him in his squad car. As Joe watches his father take Louis away,his gaze shifts to a silver locket in his hand.Four months later,the local Middle School lets out for the summer. Joe&apos;s friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) has been shooting a Super 8 film for a film festival in Cleveland. Charles has rewritten the the story so that the detective now has a wife. Joe is unsure about this last-minute rewrite,but when Charles tells him that he has gotten Alice Dainard for the part (Elle Fanning),he becomes less-concerned. The two then promise to rendezvous later that night to film their scene,with plans for Alice to drive them.Arriving home,Joe meets up with his Dad who takes him out for dinner. Jackson Lamb wants his son to attend a baseball camp for the summer,but Joe explains that he wants to help Charles finish his film. Both reach a impasse,having little more to say on the matter.Later that evening,Joe goes to meet Charles and the rest of their crew: Cary (Ryan Lee),Preston (Zach Mills),and Martin (Gabriel Basso). When Alice shows up in her Dad&apos;s Buick Skylark,she&apos;s concerned that &apos;the Deputy&apos;s Son&apos; knows she&apos;s driving without a license. Joe promises not to tell,and Alice reluctantly allows him along for the ride.The group arrives at the Lillian Train Station,where Charles intends to shoot a scene with Martin as the detective of his story,trying to get his wife (aka Alice) to leave because of a zombie infection.&#x0A;Joe is smitten with Alice,who shocks the guys when during the rehearsal,she delivers a performance that brings her to tears. The boys are snapped out of their shock by the sound of an approaching train. Charles demands they start filming again ASAP so they can put the train into their film and increase the &apos;production value.&apos;As they film the scene of the train thundering past the station,Joe catches sight of a white truck turning onto the tracks. The truck hits the train,causing a massive (and explosive) derailment. The gang runs for cover,and luckily survive the ordeal. Joe hears something pounding loudly on one of the derailed train cars right before the door flies off.Surveying the wreckage,they come across some strange white cubes (Joe takes one),and find the wreckage of the truck. Inside,they find the body of one of their local science teacher,Dr Woodward (Glynn Turman). Joe removes a map from the doctor&apos;s hand. Everyone is shocked when he starts talking to them. Pulling a gun,he threatens them and tells them that they are not to tell anyone what they saw.Suddenly,the sound of men approaching the wreck catches their attention. Fearful of being caught,they recover Charles&apos; Super 8 camera,and quickly drive off. In the car,everyone is panicked about what just happened,and Alice says her coming was a mistake.Analysis of the camera the next day reveals that it the lens is broken; however,Charles and Joe drop off the film for development. Joe insists he will help Charles finish the film,offering his Dad&apos;s video camera. However,Charles believes that Alice will most likely not want to help them after the night before.Joe goes over to Alice&apos;s house to convince her to help them finish the film. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Alice&apos;s father. He demands that Joe stay away from the family&apos;s home and Alice. Seeing that her father is somewhat drunk,she agrees to help Joe and his friends.The gang then goes out to the scene of the train-crash,this time using it as background for their filming. During the filming,Joe notices that the train features Air Force insignia. Later at a restaurant,he peruses over the map that Dr Woodward had in his possession,noting a red line drawn in,snaking across the country. The group is still unsure why Woodward did what he did,but some are of the persuasion it was a failed suicide attempt.Meanwhile,Jackson Lamb has come to the train-wreck site looking for answers. However,none of the clean-up crew or their superior,General Nelec (Noah Emmerich),is not willing to tell him anything,other than the cargo and clean-up is not hazardous. Jackson notes the government men picking up strange little white cubes,and making plaster casts of some tire tracks in the ground.The next day,the town devolves into a state of crisis,as Sheriff Pruitt (Brett Rice) goes missing. His wrecked vehicle is found near a gas station,with its windows smashed in and the attendant also missing. Jackson also receives reports of missing people,dogs and electrical equipment. While some report missing household items like microwaves,the oddest thing are missing electrical lines and engines straight out of vehicles!Jackson soon grows concerned when the Military begins to roll into Lillian. Still not receiving answers as to their presence in the town,he receives word from one of the townspeople about a radio frequency that seems to be picking up Military transmissions. Jackson has the other officers tune their radios into the frequency,and soon hears word of something codenamed &quot;Operation: Walking Distance.&quot;Shortly after hearing the transmission,Jackson encounters Alice&apos;s father Louise,who tells Jackson to keep Joe away from Alice. Upset at hearing this,Jackson tracks down Joe,and takes back his movie camera as well. Jackson finds the Military moving stuff out of Dr Woodward&apos;s home. Finding General Nelec at the site,Jackson again demands answers. When he doesn&apos;t get any,he mentions &apos;Operation: Walking Distance.&apos; This causes Nelec to agree to meet with Jackson later on that evening at a nearby airfield.Taking him home,Jackson demands that Joe keep away from the Dainards,but Joe claims that Alice isn&apos;t like her father,and that she&apos;s nice. The two once again reach a wordless impasse,before Jackson storms out of the house. He then goes to the airfield to meet with General Nelec,only to be placed under arrest and locked away.Joe heads over to the cemetery after this,where he sits at the headstone of his Mother&apos;s grave. While there,he hears some loud scraping and noises coming from a garage near the tombstones. Returning to his room later on,he is surprised when Alice appears. As they sit and talk,Alice asks Joe about the locket she&apos;s seen him carrying around. He claims it belonged to his Mother,and they retrieved it after her accident. Alice also finds Joe has a projector set up,and sees he has been watching home movies of his Mom from when he was younger. Alice tells Joe that she is sorry for the pain her Dad caused,and feels he really is not all bad. Joe tells that he also does not feel any ill will towards her Dad,when their attention is drawn to the strange white cube Joe picked up at the crash site. As they watch,it begins to vibrate,before shooting through a nearby wall,leaving a hole behind!Alice then heads home,only to find her father drunk and smoking in their living room. Disgusted by her father&apos;s behavior,she rushes out and gets on her bike. Louis drunkenly follows in his car,but ends up crashing it. As Alice is unsure what to do,a she turns to see a large creature that causes her to scream. Louis attempts to get free of his wrecked car,but finds Alice and the creature gone!The next day,Joe and Charles go to pick up the developed Super 8 film,but Charles is rather upset and cryptic towards Joe. When they finally get to Joe&apos;s place and watch the film,Charles explains that he is upset that Joe and Alice seem to be getting along and liking each other. The reason Charles cast Alice in the film,was because HE actually liked her. As they examine the film,their thoughts become turned when they see parts of a strange creature emerging from one of the wrecked train cars. As they wonder what it was they just saw,air raid sirens begin to go off.They emerge outside to find the town being evacuated,with everyone being asked to report to the local Military base. Word is that a dangerous fire is headed towards Lillian,and could cause terrible damage if it reaches the town&apos;s chemical plant. Joe and Charles get on a bus,and are transported to the base. There,Charles is reunited with his family,while Joe goes to look for his Dad. However,he instead finds Louis,who tells Joe that he saw Alice being taken away by a creature,but nobody believes him.Joe then rounds up Charles and their friends,with the intent to get back into town and rescue Alice. Bribing the town&apos;s camera-store owner to helping them,he manages to get them into town. They first go to the Middle School. Dr Woodward had a specially padlocked storage area behind the school where he hid confiscated items from his class. Joe assumes that there may be additional information as to his past,and the group finds numerous films,tapes,and records stored in there as well,that could help them find out more about the creature and how to possibly defeat it.Breaking into the school,they use a film projector in one of the classrooms. Through the materials,they learn that the creature is sub-terranean,and mainly wants to just go home. However,General Nelec was more intent on keeping the creature for Army purposes. They also found its ship contained technology that when disassembled,&apos;shattered&apos; into the little white cubes that the group saw at the crash site. Due to Woodward&apos;s interactions with the creature,he was able to gain a telepathic link to it,and notes in his findings that due to the hostilities directed towards it,it has grown hostile in nature to humans as well. The boys soon hear noises in the school,and are soon found by Nelec and his men. The group confiscate the items,as well as Joe&apos;s Mom&apos;s locket.The boys are put on a Military bus and are headed back to the base when the creature attacks the bus. The boys manage to escape while the creature attacks the other Military Officers and kills General Nelec. In the aftermath,Joe is able to obtain his Mom&apos;s locket.Meanwhile,Jackson has managed to escape his captors,and after creating a diversion,gets to the other base where the townspeople are being kept. He finds one of Joe&apos;s friends there,and after hearing of Joe&apos;s plans to rescue Alice,finds her father and takes him along. On their journey to the town,Louis explains that he came to the Lamb&apos;s house after the funeral to apologize. Jackson also admits that he knows that Louis is sorry,and quietly forgives him.The boys meanwhile,have made it back into town,but suddenly find themselves in the middle of a war zone,as tanks and other Military weaponry are going haywire,firing random shots and destroying property. As the boys attempt to escape,Martin is injured. Charles stays behind to tend to his wounds,as Joe and Cary rush off to the cemetery.Joe tells Cary about the strange things he saw and heard from the garage. Breaking down a door,they find a large hole,dug down several stories deep. Climbing down,they see it leads up into several other places. Eventually,they come across the creature&apos;s lair under the town&apos;s water tower,which houses all sorts of mechanical parts,including the missing items from the townspeople. As they watch,they see several people strung from the ceiling,including the missing Sheriff,as well as Alice! Before they can rescue her,they catch a glimpse of the creature,who is eating the limb of another human!Fearful that Alice might be next,Joe directs Cary to create a distraction using the fireworks in his backpack. This causes the distraction that Joe needs as the creature heads down the tunnel towards the loud sounds. Joe manages to save Alice,as well as the Sheriff and a woman with rollers in her hair. As they rush to find a way out,they encounter Cary,who thought he was heading towards an exit. Suddenly,the creature comes up behind them,snatching the Sheriff and the other woman into the darkness.Joe,Alice,and Cary run,but are soon at a dead end. The creature has them cornered,but Joe stands before it,reasoning with it. The creature acts hostile at first,but even in the face of its bizarre appearance,Joe does not react hostile like the previous treatment it has known. Suddenly,a sound is heard deep in the cave near the creature&apos;s lair,and it puts Joe down before returning.The three return to the surface,and congregate near the water tower. As they do,all sorts of mechanical objects in the area become magnetized to the water tower&apos;s top area.Truck trailers nearby that also contained the recovered white cubes burst open,and the cubes begin to form around the edges of the water tower as well.During the spectacle,Jackson and Louis come across their children,and both families reconcile as the creature ascends the watertower. As they watch,the locket in Joe&apos;s pocket attempts to fly away. Joe catches it,and we see what was inside it the whole time: a picture of Joe&apos;s Mom and him as a baby. Joe finally &apos;lets go&apos; of his Mom,and the locket flies up to the magnetized watertower,where he metallic objects and the white cubes morph into a spaceship. The creature climbs aboard,as the top of the water tower disappears,raining down its watery contents on the people below.Everyone watches as the ship ascends into the sky. As they do,Joe and Alice hold each other&apos;s hands. They and their families have reconciled over their past differences,but who knows what the future will bring?*Extras over the Film Credits*Over the film&apos;s credits,we see that Charles has completed his movie,titled &apos;The Case.&apos; The Super 8 film consists of a detective investigating a rash of zombie appearances that seem linked to a company called &apos;Romero Chemicals.&apos; The head of the company denies any wrong-doing,but the detective feels something is amiss. He attempts to send his wife away to keep her safe,but she refuses. While at the train station,they witness a train derailment (the footage captured on their camera replaced by model trains from Joe&apos;s collection). The detective soon encounters a doctor who has an antidote to the zombie disease,but only enough for one person. As he attempts to administer it to a captured zombie,the detective watches as the zombie bites into the doctor.After killing the zombified Doctor,the detective returns home,only to find his wife has become a zombie! He stabs her in the neck with the antidote. It appears that it has not worked,and he prepares to kill his wife. However,suddenly she returns to normal,and the two embrace.A final shot shows Charles in a suit and smoking a pipe,thanking the audience for watching,and considering them for the Cleveland film festival...before Alice pops into frame in her zombie make-up,&apos;terrorizing&apos; the camera lens.</Plot>

        <Plot>Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are about to graduate from high school. Best friends for years,they face an uncertain future: Evan has been accepted into Dartmouth but Seth will have to attend the local state university. Both boys are notably horny but still virginal,something they want to correct before leaving for college at the end of the summer. Neither is particularly popular,as evidenced when a particularly obnoxious classmates stops them before school one day to not invite them to his graduation party. Seth and Evan do have female classmates to whom they are attracted. Seth is pretty sure that Jules (Emma Stone) returns his interest,but Evan is oblivious to the fact that Becca (Martha MacIsaac) wants to get with him. Seth resents Becca both for the trouble she caused for him in first grade when she revealed his obsession with drawing penises,and because she threatens his close relationship with Evan. In home economics class,Jules invites Seth and Evan to her graduation party that night. When painfully nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) reveals that he is about to get a fake ID,Seth is determined to provide the alcohol for Jules&apos;s party. Because Becca will attend Jules&apos;s party,too,Seth is convinced that he and Evan will have sex that night.Things immediately go wrong. Seth&apos;s car is towed when he parks in the faculty parking lot. When Fogell arrives with his fake ID,Seth is appalled to learn that Fogell has adopted the name &quot;McLovin.&quot; Believing that the ID won&apos;t be accepted,Seth plans to shoplift vast quantities of liquor from a supermarket but chickens out at the last minute. Instead,he and Evan send Fogell to a liquor store. Much to his surprise,Fogell successfully uses his fake ID to buy the liquor. But before he can leave the store,he is knocked unconscious by a robber. Because they went to ogle a buxom woman down the street,Evan and Seth don&apos;t see the robbery. They do see the police car arrive and assume that Fogell is being arrested for using a fake ID. Distraught at having neither the alcohol nor the $100 Jules gave him to buy alcohol,Seth panics. He is then hit by a car driven by Francis (Joe Lo Truglio). Francis is desperate for Seth not to report the incident to the police and agrees to procure alcohol for them. Even though Francis is creepy,Seth and Evan accompany him to a house party miles from the liquor store. Shortly after getting there,Francis is beaten up by the home owner,Mark (Kevin Corrigan). Evan is angry that Seth has dragged him to this dangerous party and announces he will no longer allow Seth to dictate the course of their friendship. Seth accuses Evan of deserting him as a friend. Seth returns to the party to steal alcohol. He dirty dances with Mark&apos;s menstruating girlfriend and winds up with a blood stain on his pants. When Mark sees this,he picks a fight with Seth. Evan tries to call Becca but can&apos;t get good reception on his cell phone so goes back into the house to use a landline. He finds himself trapped in a room with cocaine snorting thugs who mistakenly think he is the golden-throated brother of someone else. He sings &quot;These Eyes&quot; to placate them. Eventually,Evan and Seth manage to escape the party with large amounts of alcohol concealed in two large laundry detergent jugs.Meanwhile,Fogell was not arrested by the police. In fact,Officers Slater and Michaels (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) seem to be impressed with his taste in alcohol and ability to take a punch. Fogell winds up spending the night with them. He helps them subdue a violent drunk at a local bar and then shares a beer with them. They reveal a rather casual attitude towards police procedure and even let Fogell hold their guns. Slater and Michaels receive a call to break up a fight at the party Seth and Evan are trapped at. On the way to the party,Slater runs into Seth,knocking him to the ground. When he discovers alcohol in one of the detergent jugs,he plans to arrest Seth and Evan. But while Slater and Michaels try to devise a plan to explain the damage to the squad car,Fogell,Evan and Seth escape along with the detergent jugs and all of the alcohol Fogell bought,which he had been carrying with him while patrolling with Slater and Michaels. They take the bus to Jules&apos;s party. On the way,Seth learns that Evan and Fogell have already decided to room together at Dartmouth.Becca is already there and already drunk. Evan learns she has spent the evening drinking heavily and announcing her intentions to have sex with him. She drags him to Jules&apos;s bedroom and drunkenly tries to seduce him. He resists,wanting their relationship to be more than physical. She throws up. Seth has no greater luck. Convinced that Jules will sleep with him only if they are drunk,he gets inebriated but is surprised to learn both that Jules doesn&apos;t drink and that she would prefer they hook up when both are sober. Confused,Seth passes out; on the way down,his head slams into Jules&apos;s,giving her a black eye. When he comes to,he sees Slater and Michaels have arrived to bust the party. He rushes inside and,finding Evan drunk and passed out,carries him to safety. Michaels and Slater find Fogell in a bedroom about to have sex with Nicola (Aviva). Slater is angry that Fogell abandoned them but Michaels calms him down. They tell Fogell that they knew his ID was fake but remembered how much they hated police officers when they were Fogell&apos;s age. Wanting to demonstrate to him that cops could be cool,too,they took him out on patrol. They all agree to be friends. To impress the ladies,Fogell has Slater and Michaels drag him away as though he were a dangerous criminal. Then they go to a deserted parking lot,do donuts in the squad car,then trash it.Evan and Seth go back to Evan&apos;s house. They make miniature pizzas and climb into their sleeping bags. They confess that they will always love one another as friends. The next day,they go to the shopping mall; Evan wants a new comforter to take to Dartmouth and Seth needs new pants. There they see Becca and Jules. Becca thanks Evan for not taking advantage of her drunkenness and Seth apologizes to Jules for his own embarrassing behavior. Becca and Evan decide to go shopping for comforters and Seth will help Jules buy makeup to cover up her black eye. Secure in their friendship,Seth and Evan are finally comfortable being apart.Summary: Two high school best friends forever (Jonah Hill,Michael Cera) go on a mission to provide alcohol for a graduation party in hopes of losing their virginity.After facing the fact that both Seth [Jonah Hill] and Evan [Michael Cera] will both be going to different colleges next year,it seems more imporant than ever that they go to a high school party,and achieve some of their long time goals; including,but not limited to,losing thier virginity with the girl of their dreams by getting them wasted and being their &quot;regret hookup.&quot; Their awkard friend Fogell [Christopher Mintz-Plasse] gets a fake ID,with just the name McLovin [it was either that or Mohammid],and agrees to get liquor to bring to Jules&apos; [Emma Stone] aka Seths dream girl&apos;s graduation party.

        <Plot>Bryan (Liam Neeson) is a retired Government Agent. He is at an electronics store and is carefully choosing a karaoke device for his beloved 17-year-old daughter Kim&apos;s (Maggie Grace) birthday. Arriving at a luxury mansion,Kim&apos;s mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) is very rude to him. Criticizing his choice of a gift and that he has even showed in the first place. The daughter is extremely pleased with her gift; however,she is soon distracted by her wealthy stepfather Stuart&apos;s (Xander Berkeley) gift of a large horse. Later,Bryan is alone in his small modest apartment. Three friends,all also retired agents,drop by for poker,steaks and beer. One of them,Sam (Leland Orser) invites Bryan to make some quick cash working security with them by escorting a female pop star to her nearby concert. After her vocal warm-up Bryan asks the pop star Sheera (Holly Vance) for advice to give his daughter who also wishes to be a singer. Sheera answers,&quot;Don&apos;t become one.&quot; At the concert,things get anxious for a moment when security is distracted by a mob of fans breaking through. Bryan escorts Sheera away from the crowd,but is confronted with a knife-wielding assailant that Bryan quickly takes down. As a &quot;Thank You,&quot; Sheera offers to help Bryan&apos;s daughter with a vocal coach and a manager if she has any natural talent.Later,Bryan gets a phone call from Kim inviting him to lunch. He is very excited and plans to let her know about Sheera&apos;s offer; however,Lenore comes to the lunch also and it becomes clear he was invited only to sign the parental-consent form Kim needs to take a vacation to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Bryan is reluctant to agree,knowing the dangers of the wrong parts of Paris,but Kim explains she&apos;ll be staying with Amanda&apos;s cousins and spend most of her time in museums. Bryan says he will consider the matter,but Kim takes it as a &quot;no&quot; and runs out crying. Lenore tears into Bryan for being such an a**hole and for being too cautious. She wants their daughter to experience life. The next day,Bryan shows up at the Stuart mansion with the signed consent,a pre-paid international cell phone,and some conditions: 1) Bryan must take Kim to the airport; 2) Kim must call Bryan when she lands in Paris; and 3) Kim must call Bryan every night to tell him the address and phone number of any new place at which she will be sleeping. At the airport,as Bryan is retrieving Kim&apos;s luggage from the car,he sees a map of Europe with several cities circled in a pocket of Kim&apos;s luggage. He confronts Lenore who admits that the girls are actually going to follow U2&apos;s European tour,not just stay in Paris. Bryan is angry,but it is too late to do anything about it.In Paris,while standing in the line for a taxi at the airport,the two girls meet a friendly,handsome young Parisian named Peter (Nicolas Giraud). He suggests they all share a taxi for the expensive ride downtown. Amanda immediately accepts and Kim reluctantly agrees. While they wait,they have Peter take their picture with Kim&apos;s phone. Chivalrous Peter has the taxi drop the girls off first. He invites them to a party that very night and Amanda eagerly accepts. As the taxi pulls away,Peter makes a quick phone call--he simply says &quot;Two girls about 18&quot; and the address of the apartment. Upstairs,Kim inquires where the cousins are at. Amanda breezily announces the cousins are on vacation in Spain and giggly announces as she jumps on the couch that she plans to have sex with Peter later on.Back in the US,a concerned Bryan checks the arrival information and learns that Kim&apos;s plane has landed. Bryan attempts to call Kim&apos;s phone; however,Amanda has cranked the music in the apartment to such a volume that neither girl hears Kim&apos;s phone ring. Finally,Bryan gets hold of Kim. Kim walks around to the other side of the loft (shaped like a square with a courtyard in between) to get away from the loud music. While they talk,Kim can see Amanda through the windows across the courtyard. As she talks to her dad,she sees two men grab Amanda and carry her body away from view while Amanda kicks and fights. Panicked,Kim tells Bryan what she just saw. Bryan immediately takes control and orders her to go into the nearest bedroom and hide under the bed. Guiding her with a careful series of questions,he learns that Kim and Amanda shared a cab with a man named Peter. Kim thinks she saw three or four man take Amanda. &quot;Now,&quot; he tells her,&quot;the next part is very important ... they are going to take you.&quot; Bryan tells her that she must leave her phone on,and she will have five to ten seconds to scream out any description of them she can. Bryan hooks up a tape recorder to his phone. Two men enter the bedroom and are puzzled they haven&apos;t found the second girl. They converse in a foreign language. Bryan tells Kim to hold the phone towards the men so he can hear their conversation. The two men appear to have left the room and Kim is relieved and tells her dad they left,when suddenly Kim is snatched from under the bed. Following Bryan&apos;s instructions,she screams out,&quot;Beard! Six Feet! Tattoo,right hand,moon and star!&quot; Bryan hears her scream for a few more seconds,then,after a moment of quiet,Bryan hears heavy breathing. Bryan tells the kidnapper,&quot;I don&apos;t know who you are. I don&apos;t know what you want. If you are looking for ransom,I can tell you I don&apos;t have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now,that&apos;ll be the end of it. I will not look for you,I will not pursue you. But if you don&apos;t,I will look for you,I will find you,and I will kill you.&quot;. . . the kidnapper responds with a thick accent,&quot;Good Luck.&quot;Bryan sends the taped conversation to Sam,his ex-agency friend from the concert. Bryan then storms over to Stuart&apos;s,his wife&apos;s second husband,and confronts him about possible business enemies of Stuart arranging Kim&apos;s kidnapping. Stuart and Lenore are surprised about how much of Stuart&apos;s business Bryan knows. Bryan is satisfied that Stuart business affairs are not the source of the problem,and he tells Stuart he needs a private jet to Paris &quot;an hour ago.&quot; Bryan searches Kim&apos;s room and all her personal possessions for possible clues. Meanwhile,he is on speaker phone with Sam so Lenore can hear. Sam provides a detailed report that identifies the language as Albanian and he even narrows the accent down to one particular town in Albania. Their leader&apos;s name is Marko and he is a very powerful figure. Sam tells him that the Albanians kidnap girls for prostitution and Bryan has,at most,96 hours (four days) before Kim will disappear forever.On the private jet,Bryan plays the recording of Kim&apos;s abduction over and over again,committing every sound to memory. In Paris,Bryan first gains access to the girl&apos;s apartment. He visualizes the abduction from the clues left behind at the scene and finds and recovers the memory card from Kim&apos;s smashed cellphone which is adjacent to the bed under which Kim tried to hide. At a do-it-yourself photo kiosk,Bryan finds the picture Peter took at the airport and zooms in on a reflection of Peter in the photo. At the airport,Peter is using the same &quot;share a taxi&quot; line with a Swedish blonde. Bryan assaults Peter to find out about the girls from yesterday; however a large man,Peter&apos;s accomplice,tries to stop Bryan. As Bryan fights off the large man,Peter runs away. Bryan disposes of the man and gives chase stealing the taxi cab. Peter runs into traffic and Bryan jumps out of the taxi and chases Peter on foot. Peter then jumps over the overpass,but a truck hits and kills him.Bryan then meets with an old acquaintance named Jean-Claude,who is with French Intelligence,to ask for help. The Frenchman tells Bryan where the Albanian-pimped hookers are located,but warns Bryan to stay out of it and to not cause any problems. As Bryan leaves,Jean-Claude sets up a tail to follow him. After getting a rental car,Bryan meets with an Albanian interpreter whom he&apos;s hired at the hooker area,first telling him to wait in the car. Bryan then deliberately wastes a prostitute&apos;s time so her pimp will come over to rough up the mild-mannered Bryan and demand some money. Bryan then plants a listening device on the pimp unbeknownst to the pimp. Back in the car,Bryan has the interpreter listen to the audio feed from the bug and translate the Albanian conversation. They talk about having trouble with some new merchandise at a nearby construction site. Bryan excuses the interpreter,but not before getting the Albanian-English dictionary he had asked him to bring.At the construction site,there is a long line of men waiting to get into a trailer. Bryan acts like a customer and joins the line. When Bryan reaches the head of the line,he hands the &quot;doorman&quot; his money and receives a scrap of paper with a single digit on it. Inside the trailer ropes have been strung with blankets draped over them to form &apos;rooms&apos; on either side of a center aisle. As Bryan walks down the aisle,he looks into each &apos;room.&apos; Bryan enters one &apos;room&apos; and finds a cot with a drugged woman lying on it. She isn&apos;t Kim. She beckons him to come to her,but,instead,he starts pulling more blankets aside to check the other &apos;rooms.&apos; Since each room has a customer,this invasion of privacy starts a ruckus. Bryan has to deal with a few bouncers as he makes his way along the length of the trailer. In the last room,Bryan sees his daughter&apos;s jacket and a drugged woman with hair like Kim&apos;s. Rushing in,he finds it isn&apos;t Kim. Bryan tries to question this woman,but she is so drugged she can&apos;t talk. So Bryan carries her to a nearby Jeep,hot-wires the ignition,and,after a wild chase,makes his escape from a swarm of angry Albanians. He drives to a quiet out-of-the-way hotel and rents two room,from the owner (another old acquaintance). In one of the rooms,Bryan rigs up an IV drip and injects the girl with a solution to rid the girl&apos;s system of drugs.Later,Jean-Claude demands a meeting with Bryan out in the open by the river. When Jean-Claude arrives,his cell phone rings. It is Bryan saying he doesn&apos;t trust meeting Jean-Claude (until he gets Kim back). Jean-Claude says his boss hit the roof over the construction site violence. While the boss wanted Bryan arrested,Jean-Claude has convinced him to authorize instead a ticket to send Bryan back to America,&quot;for previous services.&quot; Bryan refuses. Meanwhile,Jean-Claude&apos;s men have been triangulating the source of Bryan&apos;s phone call and a squad of men burst onto a nearby rooftop. There they find a cell phone rigged with a walkie talkie. Bryan is actually on another roof nearby. Bryan walks away easily.The girl comes back to consciousness and tells Bryan she got the jacket from another girl. All she can remember is it was at a house with a red doors on the rue Paradis. Bryan finds the house with the red doors,walks in bold and confident,and presents Jean-Claude&apos;s business card as his own. Bryan is led past several thugs to a dirty kitchen. Four Albanians are seated around a table. Bryan tries to ascertain who is the leader,but they all claim to be Marko and all from the town that Bryan&apos;s language expert had identified. Bryan tells them that their former police contact,Mr. Macon,had been transferred and now he (Bryan as Jean-Claude) will be collecting the bribes,the rate for which has just gone up. After some hard bargaining,a deal is struck and Bryan thinks he has identified the figure from Kim&apos;s phone. But,before he leaves,Bryan stops and says a friend gave him a note in Albanian. He hands it to the apparent leader and asks him to translate it. The leader (the real Marko) responds &quot;Good Luck.&quot; Bryan recognizes Marko&apos;s voice immediately and says to him,&quot;You don&apos;t remember me do you?. . . I told you I was going to find you,&quot; and,suddenly Bryan is shooting and fighting the house full of armed men. When the smoke clears,Bryan has killed all of them but Marko. Bryan searches for Kim in all the upper bedrooms of the building. He finds several women handcuffed to beds and Amanda&apos;s dead body (apparently dead due to a drug overdose). Bryan tortures Marko with electricity. After trying to tough it out,Marko tells Bryan Kim was sold to a man named Saint Clair. Bryan then turns the power back on and leaves Marko screaming in agony.Jean-Claude comes home for supper to discover Bryan is visiting like an old friend. Jean-Claude&apos;s wife,Isabelle,tells Jean-Claude to put the two kids to bed. As he does,he recovers a pistol from the lavatory and tucks it into the back of his waistband. At the dining room table,Bryan casually speaks about moving to Paris and drops the address of the Albanian pimp-house and Macon&apos;s name. Isabelle naively says that she herself knows Macon. Bryan then.confronts Jean-Claude on selling protection and anonymity to the Albanians and demands to know who Saint Clair is. Jean-Claude pulls out his pistol and aims it at Bryan,angrily detailing the gap between his pay and his expenses. Bryan then tosses a handful of bullets onto the dining room table and tells Jean-Claude that he has been behind a desk too long if he can&apos;t tell the difference in weight between a loaded gun and an unloaded one. Bryan pulls his own pistol and shoots Isabelle in the arm,saying,it&apos;s a flesh wound but that his next shot will kill her unless Jean-Claude provides him with information on Saint Clair. Jean-Claude then goes into his office and uses his computer to access police files that identify and locate Saint Clair. Bryan then tells Jean-Claude to tell his wife he is sorry for shooting her and he then pistol whips the Frenchman to the floor.Again posing as Jean-Claude,Bryan gains access to a party Saint Clair is hosting. Bryan discovers Saint Clair is hosting a much darker &quot;party&quot; on a lower level. Bryan assumes the guise of a waiter and gains access to a darkened room facing a wall of glass,one of a series of the same types of rooms that encircle an open stage. On the stage are a young,drugged,scantily clad young woman and a handler. In each darkened cubicle,a bidder presses a red button when they wish to bid. The auction ends and the girl is led away. The auctioneer announces the last and best woman of the evening&apos;s auction. An American,pure virgin; it is Kim!! Bryan pulls a gun on the buyer in this darkened room and forces him to outbid the others to purchase her. The bidding goes to 500,000,but,upon leaving the room with the buyer still at gunpoint,Bryan is knocked unconscious from behind. He awakens suspended from a pipe just below the ceiling. He admits to the Englishman,Saint Clair,that he is the last girl&apos;s father. Saint Clair says,&quot;too bad. It&apos;s business and she is sold already.&quot; He then orders his henchmen to execute Bryan quietly and leaves the room. Despite being shackled to the overhead pipe,Bryan manages to break the pipe loose and escape while killing the guards. Bryan meets the surprised Saint Clair standing at the elevator. Saint Clair pleads unsuccessfully for his life by saying &quot;it was just business&quot; and telling him that Kim will be at a pier. Bryan shoots him dead and sends the elevator up to the party. Bryan races to the the river,but misses the large yacht onto which Kim and other veiled women have been hustled as it cruises down the river. Bryan drives a stolen car against one-way traffic to gain position on a bridge,then jumps onto the ship as it passes underneath. On board,an Arab sheik lies on a bed in a robe as a group of women in veils are led in. Bryan fights his way through the sheik&apos;s guards and enters the bedroom,the sheik has a curved knife held to Kim&apos;s throat. Bryan takes aim and shoots the man in the head.Back in the US,Kim is reunited with her mother. Lenore even hugs Bryan in thanks. Later,Bryan mysteriously collects Kim and takes her to a very nice home. After he knocks,he takes a step back. Pop star Sheera opens the door and,over her shoulder,someone sits at a piano. Sheera takes Kim by the arm while saying she had heard Kim wants to be a singer,&quot;let&apos;s see what you&apos;ve got&quot;.</Plot>

        <Plot>A montage of news footage illustrating a violent coup that is taking place in Nigeria,overthrowing the Presidential family and establishing a dictatorship under the rebel general Yakubu. The Fulani rebels then begin a violent ethnic cleansing campaign against the Ibo (Eebow) tribes in the southern region. We then join a squad of SH-60B Seahawk helicopters on approach to the USS Harry S. Truman off the coast of Africa,and a news reporter on the flight deck reporting on the coup taking place. His report is interrupted by the news of the whole presidential family being assassinated by rebel forces.Lieutenant Waters and his team of Navy SEALs disembark from a helicopter,returning from a mission to extract American citizens from the embassy. They are greeted by Captain Bill Rhodes on the deck who immediately informs them that they&apos;ll need to be reinserted to extract a critical personality immediately. After refitting for the next mission,eating and having their wounds tended by the medic they meet in the ships briefing room to get the details of their mission. They&apos;re instructed that they will Halo Jump over Cameroon and into the jungle outside of a small Catholic mission where they will find Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (an American citizen by marriage). Their secondary mission is to extract the priest and two nuns who run the mission if they are willing to go with them. Once they have their &quot;package&quot; they are to make a twelve kilometer hike to the designated extraction point where they&apos;ll be flown out by helicopter.The mission begins precisely as planned with the SEAL team dropping from the aircraft and free falling over the target area. After forcibly having a young Nigerian woman lead the SEALs to Kendricks,Waters informs Kendricks of the rebel company approaching the mission and that their orders are to extract U.S. personnel. Kendricks refuses to leave the mission without the people under her care. Waters contacts Rhodes to explore their options and after a short and ambiguous conversation concedes to the doctor that they will take the refugees that can move under their own power with them. Kendricks agrees and immediately begins to round up every able-bodied refugee to make the hike. Irritated and behind schedule the SEALs start to move out with the refugees after daybreak. Their journey proves to be slow and hindered as guiding forty injured and wounded refugees is a difficult task.After night has fallen they decide to take a short break to allow the refugees to rest and give Dr. Kendricks time to administer medication to those that need it. Waters has his team setup a defensive perimeter around the refugees. Moments after the perimeter is set,guerrilla rebels are rapidly approaching their position,with Waters stealthily killing a straggling tailgunner. Dr. Kendricks expresses her concern to Waters that the rebels are headed for the mission,but Waters is determined to carry out his orders and they continue on their way.They finally reach their landing zone and contact the helicopters that are en route. When the choppers land,Waters&apos; initial plan becomes clear as the SEALs suddenly turn on the refugees and hold them at gun point. Waters forces Dr. Kendricks onto the helicopter and the SEAL team collapses back for a swift extraction. The refugees are left stranded in the middle of the jungle without any protection against rebel forces.During the flight back to the Truman,the helicopter crew and SEALS pass over the mission and discover that its been raided and destroyed just as Kendricks had predicted. Feeling a deep conviction,Waters orders the helicopter to turn around and regroup with the refugees. The SEALs decide on the spot to escort the refugees to the Cameroon border.During the trip,the SEALs discover that they are being tracked by a large body of rebel soldiers while using satellite scans of the area. Their pursuers are having mysterious success in their tracking of the SEALs. As they continuously attempt to escape and evade the rebels,they encounter a small village that is in the process of being destroyed and the residents executed,raped and murdered by rebel soldiers. Realizing that they have an opportunity to stop it,Waters orders the refugees to remain on the high ground while his team assaults the village. They execute their plan with surgical precision,eliminating the threat. During the aftermath of the assault,the SEAL team becomes morally conscious after seeing the after-effects of the atrocities.While continuing on their way,Slo determines that somebody within the group must be transmitting a signal that&apos;s allowing the rebels to identify their location and close in with incredible speed. It is then revealed that there is a surviving member of the Presidential family in their party,Samuel Azuka&apos;s son,Arthur,and that its very important for the rebels to ensure his death. A newer &quot;refugee&quot; is discovered in the group to have a transmitter on his person. He attempts to flee but is shot dead. Waters is angry at Dr. Kendricks because she knew all along about Arthur&apos;s true identity,yet never informed him.The SEALs unanimously continue to escort the refugees no matter what the cost is. A massive fire fight breaks out between the SEALs and the hundreds of rebels hidden in the trees. Soon the SEALs form a defensive line against the rebels as they order the refugees to retreat to the tree line where the Cameroon border is in sight. Zee radios in to the Truman for air support and two F/A-18 Hornets take off from the flight deck en route to their location.The SEALs continue to hold the line as they fall back to the refugees&apos; location. However the overwhelming firepower of the rebels claims the lives of Slo,Flea,Lake and Silk. The refugees provide a small amount of cover fire as the remaining SEALs fall back into the reeds. During the battle,Waters,Red,and Zee are all wounded. The planes forming the airstrike radio in to their location. The SEALs mark the ground with a smoke grenade and order the pilots to fire on everything between the tree line and the smoke. Arthur and Dr. Kendricks are scrambling to the gate when they hear the thunderous roar of there bed on approach. They are terrified to see the planes drop a substantial payload on the rebel fighters. With the battlefield engulfed in fire,Arthur and Kendricks fear that the airstrike wiped out Waters&apos; team.Waters,Zee,Doc and Red emerge from the grass as helicopters land on the other side of the Cameroon border as Captain Rhodes orders the guards to open the gate and let the SEALs and refugees in. A group of Marines then escort the SEALs to the helicopters where their wounds are tended to. Dr. Kendricks says her goodbyes to her friends and departs on the same helicopter with Waters.The final scene depicts the refugees recognizing Arthur as the tribal king and rightful heir to Nigeria,and he raises his hand exclaiming &quot;Freedom!&quot; as his fellow Nigerians celebrate around him. In the closing title,we see the quote &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing&quot; by Edmund Burke.</Plot>

        <Plot>The camera pans over an aerial view of New York City as news reporter April ONeil (Judith Hoag) covers a story about a string of mysterious, and seemingly organized, thefts occurring across the city. We see various scenes of members of the gang, known as the Foot Clan, stealthily stealing various items from people right under their noses. As April walks across a vacant lot at the end of the day, she stumbles on a group of thieves stealing merchandise from a van. They pin her to the ground and attempt to steal from her when, suddenly, the single light in the lot goes out and, by the time a nearby police unit arrives, the thugs have been tied up. April finds a sai lying on the ground and puts it in her purse as a mysterious pair of eyes watches her from under the lid of a manhole. The figure curses under his breath before disappearing underground.Deep in the sewers, a unique silhouette introduces the main titles before four humanoid turtles wearing colored eye-bands appear, cheering in celebration. They return to their home where their master, a large rat named Splinter (voiced by Kevin Clash), asks if they were seen and recites to them the importance of their continued training as ninjas (while one of them orders out for pizza). His attempts to meditate are interrupted when one of the turtles turns on the radio and they all start partying, except for one. The turtle with the red eye-band, Raphael (voiced and acted by Josh Pais), already irritated by the loss of his sai, announces that he&apos;s going out to a movie, wearing a trench coat and hat as a disguise. In the meantime, two of the turtles, Donatello (in purple, voiced by Corey Feldman and acted by Leif Tilden) and Michelangelo (in orange, voiced by Robbie Rist and acted by Michelan Sisti), wait for the delivery man (Michelan Sisti) and skimp out on paying full price for a 2-minute-late pizza.While out, Raphael manages to trip up a couple of thugs trying to steal from an old woman. As they run into a nearby park, Raphael follows them and meets a vigilante who introduces himself as Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), wearing a hockey mask and armed with baseball and cricket bats. Casey and Raphael get into an argument over the proper way to deal with the thugs and fight each other instead, ending with Raphael in a garbage can and fuming over being called a freak. Casey escapes and Raphael returns to the sewers where his temper is calmed with kind words from Splinter.The next day, April pays a visit to the chief of police after a report where she is criticized by Chief Sterns (Raymond Serra) for putting her nose into his business regarding the supposed organized crime wave. She walks to the subway to go home and is confronted by a team of thieves dressed in concealing ninja garb. The leader (Leif Tilden) slaps her across the face and tells her to keep her mouth shut about the Foot. When she tries to fight back they knock her out but are attacked by Raphael in disguise. The Foot leader comes to in time to see Raphael carrying the unconscious April down the subway tunnel and follows them. Raphael takes April to the turtle&apos;s hideout, to everyone&apos;s disapproval. The Foot leader peeks in through the doorway, sees the turtles, and retreats. When April wakes up, she screams at the sight of the turtles and of Splinter who proceeds to explain who they are and why they&apos;re here.Apparently, fifteen years prior, Splinter had been living in the sewers after being separated from his master, Hamato Yoshi, when he discovered four baby turtles that were moving around in some kind of toxic waste. He herded them to his home where they quickly grew larger, eventually walking on two feet and talking. Splinter noticed changes in himself as well, &apos;particularly in intellect&apos;, and began training the turtles in what he knew of the martial art of ninjutsu. He gave them names, reflecting on famous Renaissance artists: Raphael (in red), Leonardo (in blue, voiced by Brian Tochi and acted by David Forman), Donatello, and Michelangelo. Each turtle also has his weapon of choice: Raphael wields two sai, Leonardo practices swordsmanship with twin ninjato, and Donatello favors the bo while Michelangelo prefers two nunchaku.The turtles escort April home and spend some time with her, at the expense of some frozen pizza. When they return home, they find their lair broken into and Splinter missing. With nowhere else to go, they return sullen to April and spend the night in her apartment.Danny Pennington (Michael Turney), a teenage thief seen earlier in the film, is released from jail the next morning to his father, Charles (Jay Patterson), as part of a deal with Chief Sterns. Since Charles is head of Channel 3 news, Sterns releases Danny on the condition that April cease her harsh coverage on the Foot. Charles stops by April&apos;s apartment that morning and advises her to stop running her story before it gets her into further trouble. April, however, is more concerned about Charles discovering the turtles hiding around the apartment. Danny spots one briefly through a reflection before he and his father are ushered out. While driving home, Charles confronts Danny about stealing and when he stops in traffic Danny gets out of the car and runs away. He goes to an abandoned warehouse near the harbor which the Foot has claimed as its base of operation. Teenagers from across the city unload stolen items or play games under the watchful eye of Tatsu (Toshirô Obata, voiced by Michael McConnohie) who is second in command. A gong signals a mass meeting and everyone gathers in a large arena where their leader, Master Shredder (James Saito, voiced by David McCharen), a man clad in menacing ninja armor, addresses them as his outcast children. He tells them of a new threat to their order as Splinter, tied up against a wall in the back, listens. Upon mentioning the word &apos;turtles&apos;, Danny speaks up.At April&apos;s apartment, the turtles watch the news as April updates on recent thefts and sends out a personal thanks to Raphael for rescuing her. However, Raphael and Leonardo soon get into a heated argument over what to do with Splinter gone and Raphael leaves the apartment. He goes to the roof where he&apos;s ambushed by an army of Foot Clan ninjas. He is thrown, unconscious, back into April&apos;s apartment just after she gets home and the turtles are forced to fight. They all wind up in the antique shop below and are soon outnumberd as Tatsu arrives with reinforcements. However, Casey Jones suddenly appears, having spotted Raphael from the rooftops earlier, and helps the turtles escape through a secret doorway as the building catches fire. They escape in April&apos;s van and the ninjas retreat as the shop and apartment burn to the ground. Danny watches from afar.They decide to hide out at a farm that belonged to April&apos;s family and everyone pitches in to make the place more livable. Raphael remains unconscious and Leonardo provides an endless vigil. April recounts what happens in a diary and draws sketches of the turtles while trying to resist the charm that Casey puts on her. Once Raphael comes to, the turtles reconcile and resume their training. Despite their absence from the city, Shredder is bent on finding them, telling Tatsu that their method of fighting reminds him of the past. While meditating, Leonardo manages to make contact with Splinter and convinces the others to join him in a seance that night. They all share a vision of Splinter who tells them how proud he is and that they have mastered training of the mind; becoming true ninjas, before disappearing. The turtles decide to return to New York to find and rescue him.At the Foot Clan warehouse, Danny discovers Splinter who detects Danny&apos;s confusion and angst and speaks to him. He offers Danny guidance and advice during their short conversations, telling him once that &apos;all fathers care for their sons&apos;, despite Danny&apos;s anger towards his father.The turtles return to their lair and find Danny hiding out in a closet. He tells April he ran away from his father but will go back to him if he could just spend the night. Everyone agrees to let him stay and April shows and gives him one of the drawings she did of the turtles. During the middle of the night, Danny abruptly leaves, but not before drawing the attention of Casey, who follows him. They go to the Foot Clan hideout where Danny, confused, seeks out Splinter while Casey knocks out a Foot ninja and steals his outfit.Danny goes to Splinter who tells him of his time living in Japan with his master Yoshi. Splinter imitated his master&apos;s practices of ninjutsu, in which Yoshi competed with a man named Oroku Saki. Both men also competed for the love of a woman named Yang Chin, but Chin loved only Yoshi and, instead of seeing him fight for her hand, convinced him to flee with her to America. However, Saki followed them and quickly dispensed them both in a rage. Splinter escaped from his cage and leapt at Saki&apos;s face, scarring it. Saki swung at Splinter, slicing part of his ear, before disappearing. Danny asks what became of Saki to which Splinter replies that no one truly knows, but Danny wears his emblem on his head band. Shredder discovers the two, asking where Danny&apos;s been before removing the drawing from his back pocket. He angrily walks away to gather his forces and tells Tatsu to kill &apos;the rat&apos;. Hearing this, Danny rushes back where he runs into Casey and explains that they have to rescue Splinter. They manage to get him out of his chains but are stopped by Tatsu and a team of ninjas.Meanwhile, the Foot sets out to ambush the turtles in their hideout but are surprised by a sneak attack. The turtles fiercely fight back and bring the conflict to the streets above where they eventually wind up on a rooftop. As they fight, Casey engages Tatsu in one on one combat and manages to overpower him. Before leaving, he questions the gang members on their idea of this so-called family that they&apos;re a part of.After dispatching a few remaining ninjas, the turtles are surprised by the sudden appearance of Shredder who engages the turtles in combat, but they prove to be no match for him. When the turtles ask about Splinter, Shredder mocks them and implies that Splinter is dead. Furious, Leonardo rushes him only to be pinned. The other turtles are forced to throw down their weapons. Before another blow can be struck, Spinter appears on the roof and speaks out to Shredder, addressing him as Oroku Saki. Shredder charges Splinter with a yari but is flipped over the roof by Splinter&apos;s quick movements, using one of Michelangelo&apos;s discarded nunchaku. Using the coil of the nunchaku, Splinter holds Shredder by his yari precariously over the edge of the roof. When Shredder throws a knife at him, Splinter releases his grip, causing Shredder to fall into the compactor of a garbage truck. Casey casually flips a switch and the hydraulic door closes, crushing Shredder&apos;s mask.The turtles reunite with Splinter as police arrive on the scene and question the remaining Foot members who reveal where all the stolen goods are kept. April prepares to run a final update on the story when news crews arrive and gives Casey a celebratory kiss. The turtles cheer and exchange slang exclamations before Splinter says that his favorite has always been &apos;cowabunga&apos;. The turltes unanimously agree and cheer as Splinter laughs, saying he &apos;made a funny&apos;, and the film ends.</Plot>

        <Plot>SHORTIn 1994,a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong),the future leader of humanity in a 21st century war against machines. A competing machine (Robert Patrick),the T-1000,is sent back to kill John. With the aid of John&apos;s mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton),the cyborg manages to destroy the T-1000 at a confrontation at a steel mill. However,the cyborg must then destroy itself in order to eliminate its chance of being used to help fuel the future war with the machines. Sarah helps the cyborg destroy itself,but not before the cyborg consoles John,quietly assuring him that everything will be okay. Sarah then notes that if a machine can learn the value of human life,perhaps people can,too.LONGScenes in red indicate scenes that appear only in the Special Edition of Terminater 2: Judgment Day.Production credits appear in shots of traffic lines and children playing in playgrounds. The shot starts to fade into blue as the sounds of children&apos;s voices die out,followed by a flash-forward to Los Angeles in 2029 AD. The world has become a wasteland of wrecked cars,destroyed buildings,and black-charred playgrounds filled with skeletons and skulls. The voice of Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) starts narrating: &quot;3 billion human lives ended on August 29th,1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day. They only lived to face a new nightmare: the war against the machines.&quot;The foot of a metallic android smashes a skull on the ground. A battle is starting between human guerrilla troops and a technically far superior robotic army. Crushing skulls beneath their tracks,robotic tanks open a full-frontal assault on the humans,who are trained to make use of what shelter the ruined terrain offers them. Flying aircraft search the ground for targets,as T-800 androids sweep the terrain at places the tanks cannot access. Although they suffer heavy losses,the humans manage to destroy several tanks,aircraft and androids. They even use old cars as crude assault vehicles,but the machines lasers are accurate and unrelenting.A man is saluted by his soldiers as he crosses a destroyed hallway and starts to inspect the battlefield from a safe distance. The camera zooms in on his scarred face as Sarahs voice-over continues: &quot;Skynet,the computer that controlled the machines,sent two terminators back through time; their mission: to destroy the leader of the human resistance: John Connor,my son. The first Terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year 1984,before John was born. It failed. The second was set to strike at John himself when he was just a child.&quot; The close-up of John Connor dissolves into a blaze of inferno,as Sarah continues: &quot;As before,the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior as a protector for John. It was just a question of which one would reach him first.&quot;The opening credits start playing in a montage of shots of playground burning in an inferno. The credits end as the camera starts zooming into the metal face of a Terminator,through the fire,until its red glowing eyes are in extreme close-up.Flashback to present day. A truck starts its engine and drives away from a truck stop,where a wind suddenly starts to blow and electric charges fill the air. Out of nowhere,a brightly-lit orb appears,cutting out parts from the ground and a nearby truck. The orb dissolves,leaving a crouching,naked man in its place. As the electrical charges slowly fade,the man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rises to his feet. It is a Terminator,same appearance as the one that got sent through time in The Terminator to kill Sarah Connor. We see its red point-of-view processing screen as it approaches a biker bar called The Corral and inspects the motorcycles in front of it,before it enters through the door. Inside,the pool-playing and drinking biker population watches with a mixture of astonishment and amusement as the completely naked man calmly walks in between them,inspecting every male costumer on the way. It stops in front of a cigar-smoking biker as it finds out that the mans clothes are a match to its body size. The Terminator calmly tells him that he needs his clothes,boots and motorcycle,to much hilarity of the other customers. The cigar man tells it that he forgot to say please and blows smoke in Terminators face. He then puts out his cigar on Terminators bare chest,only to find out to his amazement that it doesnt seem to feel the pain. Terminator forcefully grabs the mans hand and twists his arm. Another biker hits Terminator in the head with a pool cue,but he gets thrown out of the front window by the unaffected Terminator. The cigar biker is thrown into the kitchen on the hot stove,and when another biker trying to attack gets nailed to the pool table with his own knife,the rest of the customers decide to pull off their attack. Terminator enters the kitchen and quickly pulls away the gun the cigar biker pulled out,after which he throws Terminator his keys and tells it to take it.Terminator steps outside,fully dressed,and mounts one of the motorcycles,as the barkeeper comes out and fires a warning shot with his shotgun,threatening to kill him if he doesn&apos;t come off the bike. With a quick move,Terminator relieves him of his shotgun and sunglasses without hurting the man. He puts on the glasses and leaves on the bike.In a different part of town,a police officer calls in a strange electrical disturbance to Headquarters. As he inspects the area and notices a strange round hole burned into a fence,he is approached from behind by another naked man (Robert Patrick),more slender than Terminator,who instantly kills him with a quick jab in the gut. The man picks up the cops gun,enters the police car fully clothed,and accesses the cars computer to find the address of John Connor.At John Connor&apos;s house,his foster parents Todd (Xander Berkeley) and Janelle Voight (Jenette Goldstein) make several fruitless attempts to get John to clean up his room,but he just ignores and ridicules them and leaves on his bike with his friend Tim (Danny Cooksey).Pescadero State Hospital,a detention centre for the criminally insane. Sarah Connor has been incarcerated here and is performing some exercises in her cell. Psychiatrist Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) is showing some interns around,telling them about Sarahs acute schizo-affective disorder,which leads her to believe that a machine in human guise,called the Terminator,was sent back through time to kill her,and that the father of her child was a soldier from the future,sent back to protect her. Silberman greets her good morning,to which Sarah politely asks about his knee,which she stabbed with a pen some weeks before. Silberman has the interns take a look at her like she is a caged animal,and then asks two orderlies to make sure that Sarah tidy her room and take her medicine. The orderlies enter the cell,but Sarah refuses the medication. They tell her to be good because she is on review that afternoon,but when she keeps refusing,they smack her in the gut with a baton,kick her around and zap her with a tazer before they force the medication down her throat..&#x0A;Meanwhile,the fake police man arrives at the house of John Connor,asking his foster parents about John. When they indicate that John has gone,he asks for Johns picture,saying he needs to ask John some questions. Todd mentions a big guy on a bike asking about John too that morning,but the officer assures them not to worry. At that moment,John is raiding an ATM with a special machine. Tim finds a picture of Sarah in Johns bag (it is THE picture,the one that was taken of Sarah at the end of The Terminator,and was later given to Johns father,Kyle Reese[/spoiler]),to which John comments that Sarah is a complete psycho,because she got arrested for trying to blow up a computer factory. They take off for the mall to spend the stolen cash,missing the searching Terminator by a few blocks.Sarah is in deep sleep from the medication,when she is woken by a familiar voice. It is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn),the man who died protecting her from the first Terminator. He tells her that John is in danger and that she needs to protect him,to which she replies that he doesn&apos;t believe her anymore. Reese talks some strength back in her and repeats his earlier message: the future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. She hugs him,but when she opens her eyes,Reese is standing in the cell door opening,saying that there is not much time left in the world. He walks away,and Sarah follows him out of the hospital. She finds herself on a sunny grass field behind a fence. On the other side are children playing in a playground. She tries to warn them away,but no sound comes from her mouth. Then there is a sudden bright flash,and she wakes up next to her bed in her cell. During the psychological review later that day,Sarah watches a video from one of her earlier evaluations,where she described her dream of the world and its children burning in a nuclear nightmare. She went into a fit of rage,because no one seemed to believe her that it will be reality. Silberman stops the video,and Sarah tells him that she is feeling much better now; she no longer believes in the existence of Terminators,and recants her claim that the factory where she crushed one covered the whole thing up.Meanwhile,in a compute lab elsewhere,a computer developer called Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) is asked permission to conduct a test with a device that is only referred to as &apos;it&apos;. When one of his co-workers asks where it came from,he gives him the same answer he received from his superiors: Don&apos;t ask. Dyson goes into the vault,where he observes a fragment of a computer chip,and a metal robot arm that was clearly once attached to a Terminator.Sarah requests Silberman to be transferred to a minimum security ward,but he doesn&apos;t believe her and thinks she will try to escape again. When he also refuses to let her see her son,she attacks him before she is being restrained and drugged by wardens.John is driving with Tim through and abandoned canal,while the Terminator passes overhead,identifies him and lays in a pursuit. Meanwhile,the fake officer shows Johns picture to a couple of girls,who direct him to the Galleria. Terminator arrives at the Galleria and identifies John&apos;s bike. While John is inside playing arcade games,both the fake cop and the Terminator (carrying a box of roses) are searching for him. The cop is directed to the game hall,where he bumps into Tim who is getting some more quarters. He shows Tim Johns picture,Tim pretends he doesn&apos;t know the person,but quickly walks back to John and warns him that a cop is looking for him. John runs away,being chased by the cop,and ends up trapped in a hallway between the Terminator,who produces his shotgun from the box of roses,and the cop. Terminator,however,shoots the cop with his shotgun,but the cop quickly recovers and fires an entire clip at John,thereby killing an innocent bystander. The Terminator quickly puts himself in front of John,acting as a shield. He puts John into safety and returns fire at the cop,who staggers backward and falls to the ground,motionless. But,as Terminator reloads his gun,the large metallic holes the shots made in the cop&apos;s chest suddenly fill up. The cop gets up and there is a short struggle between him and Terminator for the gun. In the fight,they force each other into the wall several times,until one wall finally gives,and they tumble into a fashion store. The cop is quicker on his feet,throws Terminator through the shop-window,and gets back to chasing John. Shoppers are amazed to see Terminator get back on his feet so quick (one of them manages to take some pictures),grabbing his gun and following after John too. In the meanwhile,John has reached his motorcycle,but has problems getting it to start. As the cop enters the garage and dashes towards him,John drives away,hardly being able to shake off his assailant as he makes it to the street. The cop hitches a ride from a passing truck by throwing its driver out of it,and lays in a pursuit of John with little regard for other road-users. He,in turn,is being chased by the Terminator on its motorcycle. John makes it to the old drainage canal,apparently in safety,but the truck suddenly comes up from a bridge and takes an immense dive into the canal. John takes off,and although the canal is a hard place for manoeuvring a truck,it and its driver keep gaining on John. In the meanwhile,Terminator is driving alongside the edge of the canal,firing some shots at the truck,which is nearing a bridge spanning the canal. The bridge effectively rips off the truck cabins roof,but the cop has ducked away and is still in control of the vehicle. He tries to overrun John,as the Terminator reaches a dead end in the elevation,and is forced to jump with its bike into the canal. It manages to pass the truck and drive alongside John,picks him up from his bike,puts him in front of itself,and puts a bullet in the truck&apos;s tire. The truck crashes into another column in the canal,and blows up. Terminator stops the bike,points his gun at the blazing fire,but only a burning tire rolls out. He drives away with John,but seconds later,a shiny,featureless,metallic man emerges from the blaze. Its features start to become more pronounced and its colours return to normal,forming into the unharmed cop again.John asks the Terminator to pull over the bike. His rescuer confirms it is a Terminator; it is from Cyberdyne systems,model 101: a cybernetic organism,living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. John checks the bullet holes in the Terminator&apos;s back,but still has a hard time buying it. He already realizes that the Terminator has not come to kill him. Terminator explains that John himself reprogrammed it 35 years in the future to be his protector in the present.At the canal,the fire brigade has started to extinguish the fire from the crashed truck. The fake cop is observing silently,as he steals a police car unnoticed.It&apos;s evening,and while driving the bike,Terminator explains that the other guy is a T-1000: an advanced prototype mimetic polyalloy,or,liquid metal. It says they have to get out of the city and avoid the authorities. John wants to stop by his house,but Terminator assures him the T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire him there,as it itself would try.They stop by a pay phone because John insist on calling his foster parents to warn them. Janelle answers,and expresses her concern for John. John is confused,as she is never this nice. He can hear Todd through the phone yelling at the dog for barking continuously,but he is suddenly silenced. John worries that the T-1000 might be there already. Terminator asks John for the dog&apos;s name; its Max. He takes over the horn and asks Janelle in Johns voice what is wrong with Wolfy. Janelle says Wolfy is fine. Terminator hangs up and says John&apos;s foster parents are dead. The camera pulls back on Janelle and shows that her arm has been gradually formed into a silver blade,which has skewered Todd&apos;s head. She retracts the blade,and it slowly reforms into her arm. Then Janelle melts into the featureless silver man,who immediately reshapes into the T-1000 in cop costume.Terminator explains to John that the T-1000 can imitate everything of equal size that it has sampled previously by physical contact. It can&apos;t become a bomb or other complex machines with chemicals and moving parts,but it can form knives and stabbing weapons.The T-1000 walks outside to the backyard of the Voight&apos;s house toward Max the dog,who is barking loudly. It kills the dog with a quick jab,and rips off its collar; it reads &apos;Max&apos;. It knows he has been fooled.At Pescadero Hospital,a police detective shows Sarah Connor some pictures from the West Highland police station,taken by a video surveillance camera in 1984. They show the first Terminator on a killing spree inside the station. The detective explains that the man killed 17 policemen with families and children that night. His colleague shows her pictures taken by a tourist at a mall in Reseda today: they show the exact same man. The officers tell her John is missing and that his foster parents were murdered,and ask her about the guy in the picture,but she doesn&apos;t give the slightest response. Dr Silberman tells them it is no use,and lets them out. Sarah secretly takes a paperclip from the desk before one of the wardens takes her back to her cell.John tells the Terminator about his childhood in Nicaragua where Sarah hooked up with several guys to gather weapons and teach John to become a great military leader. John now realizes that she was right all the time,and he wants to rescue her. Terminator refuses,stating that T-1000 will most likely copy Sarah and wait for John to come over. When John hears that the subject being copied is typically terminated,he insists on going immediately. Terminator restrains him,stating Sarah is not a mission priority. John objects and calls out for help,but when he orders it to let go,the android complies. To his joy,John finds out that obeying him is one of the Terminator&apos;s mission parameters. John tests it by ordering it to stand on one foot: it complies. Two guys are responding to John&apos;s cry for help. They get into an argument,and John has Terminator grab one of the guys by his hair. When the other guy attacks,Terminator breaks his hand and tries to shoot him; John can narrowly avoid this from happening,and sends the guys away. He tries to explain Terminator why he can&apos;t just kill people,but the robot doesn&apos;t understand. John tries to convince it that it is something he just can&apos;t do,orders it to help him save his mum,and they ride on.In the meantime,T-1000 arrives at Pescadero and is admitted by one of the guards. Sarah is restrained to her bed by Douglas the warden (Ken Gibbel). He humilliates her some further,locks her cell and bangs his baton against several cell doors as he leaves. Sarah spits out the paperclip she stole and uses it to pick the locks of her restraints,and the door lock. T-1000 comes up at a desk and asks the nurse for Sarah Connor. She tells him that other cops have already been with her for an hour,as she sees them coming out. When she looks back at T-1000,she notices that he has gone; he is nowhere in the hallway. She lets Lewis (Don Stanton),one of the guards,through the security door,who shows the police officers out before he walks over to a coffee machine. But as he steps on the chequered hallway floor,immediately a face appears out of it. It is the T-1000,mimicking the floor,rising up and slowly copying the shape and image of Lewis,who is unaware of his counterpart forming behind him. He then turns around,and is astounded to see himself facing him. T-1000 pierces Lewis head by quickly extending his finger into a long ice pick-like extension,and drags him into a cleaning room. He then makes his way to the maximum security wing.&#x0A;Meanwhile,Douglas finds that one of the maintenance rooms has been opened,and that a broom handle has been broken off. As he exits the room,he is getting punched to pulp by Sarah with the broom handle,dragged and locked into her room. She takes his keys and baton and leaves. She hides away for Lewis (actually the T-1000) who is walking in one of the adjacent wings. T-1000 changes back into the cop,as Sarah sneaks up to Silberman and a warden. She beats the warden unconscious and breaks Silbermans arm. She drugs the warden with a tranquillizer and fills the empty syringe with sink cleaning fluid.&#x0A;John and the Terminator arrive at Pescadero,and John makes it swear that it will not kill anyone. When the guard won&apos;t let them through the gate,Terminator shoots him in the legs,reassuring John that the man will survive. They park the motorcycle in the garage. Sarah arrives with Silberman as her hostage at the security office. She has the poison-filled syringe in his neck,and she reassures Silberman that she has no problems killing him,since she already believes him dead anyway. He makes the guards open the door. She gets through but doesn&apos;t notice another guard behind her. He saves Silberman from her hands,but gets punched to the floor. Sarah makes a run for it,and the guards sound the alarm,which also attracts attention from the T-1000,which just discovered the drugged guard. Sarah manages to lock out the chasing wardens by breaking off a key,so they have to find an alternate route. Sarah makes it to an elevator,and pushes the button. One of them opens,but to her horror,an old acquaintance walks out. It is the Terminator,her tormentor from the past! With a yell of fear and disbelieve,she runs back the other way. Blind panic has struck her so much,that she hardly notices John&apos;s calls,and the wardens who have found another access,work her to the floor and try to subdue her. John asks Terminator to help his mother. It walks over to the wardens,who have a hard time restraining Sarah who is frantically yelling &quot;He&apos;ll kill us all!&quot;. Dr Silberman tries to give Sarah a tranquillizer shot,but Terminator grabs the wardens around him one by one,and smashes them against the windows and walls,knocking them out but not killing them. John crouches down to Sarah,who is looking at him and Terminator in utter disbelief. John assures her that the Terminator is here to help,and she grabs its hand. But at that time,T-1000 appears at the end of the hallway,blocked by a set of bars. It walks through them with ease,its liquid metal pouring through the bars like gelatine pudding. John and Sarah run to the elevator as Terminator fires several shots at T-1000,which slow it down. T-1000 runs past a stunned Silberman,firing,but Terminator serves as shield again,before the elevator doors close behind him. T-1000,however,uses his knife-arms to pry the door open,but Terminator quickly fires a shot at his head at point blank,splitting the head apart. The elevator goes down as T-1000 melts its head back together. It pries the doors open again and jumps on the roof of the elevator,stabbing his knives through the roof hoping to hit one of its targets. Terminator and Sarah fire several shots back at the roof before Sarahs shoulder is cut by one of T-1000&apos;s lucky stabs. The elevator arrives at the garage,and they all exit. Sarah &apos;commandeers&apos; another police car that is just arriving. In the meanwhile,T-1000 has perforated the roof far enough to pour himself through a small hole as an amorphous blob of metal. He quickly reshapes into human form,opens the elevator door and starts to chase,so Terminator is forced to drive away in reverse. They fire several clips and shells at it,but it keeps gaining. After exiting the garage,Terminator manages to spin the car 180 degrees,but this momentary slow-down allows T-1000 to make a jump at the car,and haul himself onto it with its arm-hooks. It smashes the back window and slices at John,but Terminator manages to shoot it off the driving car. It gets back on its feet,but stops its pursuit as it realizes it cannot keep up with the car on foot. John notices a severed hook still sticking in the car&apos;s trunk,and throws it on the street. T-1000 walks towards it,merges the hook back into its foot,and walks back to Pescadero.John,Sarah and Terminator drive away at high speed,safe from the deadly T-1000,at least for now. Sarah opens her arms to John,apparently to give him a big hug,but she only wants to check him for wounds or bruises. John assures her that he is okay,but Sarah reprimands him for risking his life trying to save her; he is too important for that. John is baffled by Sarahs cold reaction,saying that he just needed to get her out of there,but she bluntly responds that she can take care of herself. Terminator inquires John about the tears in his eyes,but he says its nothing.T-1000 returns on foot at Pescadero,where the police have arrived. A cop on a motor cycle asks if he is okay. It affirms,and compliments the cop with his nice motor cycle.The three fugitives arrive at an old abandoned gas station,and they hide the car inside the garage. Terminator tends to Sarahs shoulder wound,stating that it knows what it is doing because it has detailed files on human anatomy. Sarah remarks that this makes him a more efficient killer; Terminator confirms the notion. Sarah in turn removes the bullets from Terminators back. John asks is it feels any pain,to which Terminator replies that it senses injuries,which could be regarded as pain. It explains that its wounds will heal up,which is good according to Sarah,because he won&apos;t be of much use if he can&apos;t pass for a human. Terminator explains to John that it will last 120 years with its existing power cell; that its CPU (central processing unit) is a learning computer and that it can learn more about being human as it has more contact with humans.Alternative scene: Terminator explains to John that its CPU is a learning computer,but Skynet disables the learning ability when Terminators are sent out alone. When John suggests that they can reset the switch,he and Sarah start operating the Terminator. She removes part of its scalp,opens its metal skull,and removes the chip inside,shutting down the android completely. However,to John&apos;s horror,she wants to destroy the chip,because she doesn&apos;t trust Johns new friend. She wants to use this rare opportunity to disable it,but John convinces her that they need it,and that if he is to be a great military leader,she should start listening to some of his ideas for a change. Reluctantly,she concedes,and they reinsert the chip.The Terminator keeps watch all night,and at dawn,he commandeers another vehicle by hotwiring it; John teaches him that some cars have the keys tucked behind the sun visor. To get away from the city as fast as possible,they drive through the desert to one of Sarah&apos;s hideout places. John notices how the Terminator always uses words like &quot;affirmative&quot;; he teaches him to use more colloquial terms as &quot;no problemo&quot;,&quot;eat me&quot;,&quot;hasta la vista,baby&quot; and &quot;chill out,dickwad&quot;. They stop at a gas station for some food. John notices how his mother is so serious all the time,and he tells the Terminator that it could smile once in a while too. To give an example,John does an unsuccessful attempt to make on the restaurant attendants smile,then points at a guy at a phone booth smiling. Terminator tries to imitate him,but the result is less than convincing,so John advices it to practice in front of a mirror first.&#x0A;John sees some children playing with toy guns. He ponders that humans as a species probably won&apos;t make it; Terminator comments that it is in their nature to destroy themselves. Sarah inquires about who is responsible for building Skynet. As they start driving again,Terminator tells her that it is Miles Bennett Dyson,a high- ranking employee at Cyberdyne Systems,who will invent a new microprocessor that will revolutionize the entire military computer system. Cyberdyne computers will completely replace human functions and decisions in strategic defense systems as the Skynet program goes on-line on August 4th,1997. It learns at such a fast rate that it becomes self-aware on August 29th. As the humans try to shut it down,Skynet starts a nuclear strike that plunges Earths nations into a nuclear war,in which the humans destroy each other. Sarah asks for detailed files about Dyson.At the Dyson residence,Miles is frantically working on his computer,even though he promissed his wife Tarissa (S. Epatha Merkerson) to take the children out swimming. Miles tries to explain to her that his work on the new microprocessor is very important and that he is very close to completing it. Tarissa jokingly wonders why they started a family anyway,since he seems more concerned with his project. Miles surrenders,and takes the kids out to play.Sarah,John and Terminator arrive at a outlying farm in the desert,that seems abandoned. However,her friend Enrique Salceda (Castulo Guerra,being very suspicious of unannounced visitors,comes out of hiding at the sound of her voice. He welcomes Sarah,John and Terminator (who John introduces as Uncle Bob) and tells them that they are all over the news as wanted persons. Enrique is not too thrilled to hear that Sarah has come to collect most of his stuff: clothes,food and a truck; she orders John and Terminator to gather weapons. Terminator opens a secret stash filled with lots of weapons and ammunition. Sarah notifies Enrique about her plans to cross the border after nightfall,and tells him to leave the range as well,since it is dangerous for him too. He already expected that Sarah would bring trouble,but he seems to be used to it.&#x0A; While working in the weapons stash,John tells how he grew up learning about weapons and explosives,and how he had a hard time adjusting to a normal life after Sarah got arrested. He learns from the Terminator that it has no fear of death,nor feels any other emotion about it; it just has to stay functional until its mission is complete. John thinks about himself the same way,although he is not too keen about the important role he has yet too play. Terminator uncovers a minigun,which makes even the cyborg smile.&#x0A;While assisting Terminator in repairing a truck,John wonders about his real father,who he will meet when he is in his forties,but who hasn&apos;t even been born yet. John thinks Sarah still cries about him sometimes. Terminator asks him why people cry. John tells him it happens when people are hurt,although not physically. The machine doesn&apos;t understand. When the truck works again,John teaches Terminator how to do a high five,as Sarah watches them from a distance. She narrates: &quot;Watching John with the machine,it was suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop,never leave him,never hurt him,never shout at him or get drunk and hit him,or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there,and it would die to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years,this machine was the only one who measured up. In an insane world,it was the sanest choice.&quot;&#x0A;Sarah carves her knife into a wooden table,and watches Enrique playing happily with his family. She falls asleep,and finds herself in a green pasture,behind a fence. On the other side,children are playing in a playground. She tries to warn them away,but no sound comes from her mouth. She sees a younger,innocent version of herself among the people: dressed in her old waitress uniform,playing with infant John,also seemingly aware that something is wrong. As Sarah vainly pounds the fence in frustration,a blinding white flash illuminates the area. IWith screams of terror,everybody faces away from the white light. As the bright light dies down,it reveals a huge nuclear cloud column at the horizon. In an instant,the ambient temperature is raised to extremes,causing Sarah,everyone and everything to spontaneously burst into flames. A panoramic shot shows a nuclear shockwave propagating itself through downtown LA,turning every building in its path into instant rubble. Cars,busses,building and trees are singed and blown to pieces,and as the fire reaches the burnt people,their ashes are spread like black dust in the wind. As the fire burns Sarah&apos;s flesh away,leaving only her skeleton hanging by the fence,she wakes up with a shock,realizing it was a dream. She looks at the words she just carved into the table: NO FATE; she knows that she can only stop her dream from becoming reality if she acts now.&#x0A;Sarah sticks the knife into the table,gathers a M16 rifle and her gear,and gets into the car. John sees it,and hears from Enrique that he and Terminator are supposed to proceed towards the south,where Sarah will team up with them tomorrow. John runs towards Sarah,trying to talk to her,but she drives off quickly without a word or looking back. John reads the words on the table: NO FATE. John explains to Terminator that it was a message from his future self to Sarah,passed on by his father Kyle: The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. When Terminator guesses that Sarah intends to change the future,John suddenly realizes that she is going after Miles Dyson. They quickly take off in the repaired truck.As Sarah is racing ahead,Terminator warns John that T-1000 has the same data files,and might be waiting for them at Dyson&apos;s house,but John is intent on stopping Sarah. Terminator suggests that Dyson&apos;s murder might actually prevent the war from happening,but John does not want to hear about it. He angrily blames Terminator for still not understanding the value of human life. The cyborg still has difficulties to care about anything,but John insists that it try to learn it.Sarah has arrived at the Dyson residence and sets up her silenced gun behind the swimming pool,where she can see Miles working on his computer,unaware of the danger outside. Dysons son Danny (DeVaughn Nixon) is playing in the house with his remote controlled car,waving off his mothers orders to go to bed like his sister. Outside,Sarah loads the rifle and takes aim,pointing a red laser at the back of Miles head. At the moment of firing,Danny drives the remote car against Miles&apos; foot,making him bend over to pick it up. The bullet misses him and hits the computer screen. With Miles realising the shot came through the window,Sarah fires again but misses. Miles takes cover behind his desk,so Sarah takes the house under rapid fire. Miles warns away his wife and son as Sarah reloads and empties another clip into the room. She takes a handgun and walks over to the house. Miles sees her and makes a run for his living room. Sarah fires several shots at him,and the third one hits Miles in the shoulder. He collapses to the floor as his wife and son get to him. Sarah tries to force them away at gunpoint,but the young boy stays,pleading for his fathers life. Miles pushes the boy away to his mother,asking Sarah to let the boy go,but her eyes are wild with rage. She raves at the bewildered man that everything is his fault and that she will not let him do it. Miles starts to cry uncontrollably,which weakens Sarah&apos;s resolve,making her realise what she is about to do,and prevents her from pulling the trigger. She backs away and sinks to the floor,crying. In the meanwhile,John and Terminator enter the ravaged house,fearing that they are too late. John takes care of his mother and tells Terminator to check the Dysons. Sarah is almost traumatized,realising that she almost killed a man,and John hugs her,assuring her that they will find a way. Finally she is able to tell him she loves him,and show her affection back. Terminator diagnoses that Miles&apos; injury is only a flesh wound,and that his wife can stop the bleeding by pressing the wound. Miles asks John and Terminator who they are. John gives Terminator a knife,tells it to show to Miles what it is,and takes Danny away to his room. With gasps and cries of horror and disbelief,Miles and his wife watch the Terminator make large cuts in its arm,and remove the skin to reveal a sophisticatedly crafted,bloody metal arm and hand,the same kind Miles saw on display at Cyberdyne. Terminator requests that Miles and Tarissa listen carefully.Sarah narrates: &quot;Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down. Skynet,Judgment Day,the history of things to come. Its not every day that you find out you are responsible for 3 billion deaths. He took it pretty well.&quot; Miles is taken aback by the story,but tries to defend himself against accusations for things he has not even done yet by asking how he was supposed to know. Sarah sneers that this is the excuse of all men,thinking they are great and creative,but invent nothing but death and destruction. John cuts off her reproaches,because those sort of discussions dont get them anywhere. Miles tells them he will stop working on the processor and quit his job at Cyberdyne,but Sarah and Terminator convince him that nobody must be allowed to finish his work; the lab and all relevant files in his home must be destroyed also. Miles ask if they know about the chip at Cyberdyne,which came from the first Terminator,although he was not informed about its origin at the time; this confirms all of Sarahs suspicions about the factory covering up the whole incident with her and the first Terminator. The chip was broken,but it gave Miles the inspiration for his revolutionary new chip design. Miles offers to help them pass Cyberdynes security to destroy it as well.The camera moves fast over a road at night as Sarah narrates: &quot;The future,always so clear to me,had become like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now,making up history as we went along.&quot;&#x0A;The group arrives at the Cyberdyne building,packed with large bags full of equipment. Miles gets them through the main entrance to the security desk,and tries to convince the guard that they are friends who he wants to show around. As the guard berates him about visitors needing special authorization,they draw their weapons and Terminator tells him that it insists. They restrain the guard and use an elevator to move to the second floor,where Miles explains how they need his key and another one in the security station to open the vault where the chip and Terminator arm are.&#x0A;Meanwhile,another guard returns to the front desk,and grumbles at his partner for just leaving the desk unattended,only to find the man tied up and gagged inside the toilet. Miles and Sarah enter the security station,as the guard triggers the silent alarm. Because of this,Miles&apos; access card cannot open the key locker anymore; the alarm has neutralized all codes inside the building. He wants to abort,but Sarah convinces him they have to go all the way. John assures them that his special machine for illegally withdrawing money from ATMs will do the trick. Meanwhile,the two guards downstairs have identified Sarah and Terminator as the two wanted criminals from the news,and call for all police units in the area. Miles&apos; entry code is no more use to open the door to the lab,so Terminator suggests to use his,which means blowing through the door with a grenade launcher. This sets off the gaseous fire extinguishing system,preventing Sarah and Miles from entering the lab. However,Terminator can walk through the gasses unharmed,and retrieves two breathing masks for them. They enter the lab and get to work.Meanwhile,T-1000 has arrived at the Dyson residence,wearing a motor cop suit,helmet and shiny glasses. He finds the house deserted,all computers destroyed and several stacks of paper burning. He hears a dispatch on his police radio,calling in the situation at Cyberdyne Systems,and the suspects: Sarah Connor,escaped from Pescadero State Hospital the night before; and a white male,possible killer from the West Highland Police Station massacre in 1984.Terminator is chopping up several computers and servers with a fire axe. Miles directs Sarah to all the disks and processors containing important data that is to be destroyed. Sarah tells him they will blow it all up. Then Miles sees the enlarged model of his new chip design. He asks Terminator for his axe,says he worked a lot of years on the model,then smashes it apart with a violent strike of the axe.&#x0A;A large police force arrives at the Cyberdyne building,the police radio calling the suspects &apos;armed and extremely dangerous&apos;. The police lay siege to the building,while a police helicopter circles around,shining its spotlight inside a deserted office area. John has finally opened the key locker and retrieves the vault key. As he leaves,he can narrowly avoid being spotted by the helicopter. A quick glimpse on a monitor shows him the entire police force barricaded outside. Sarah and Terminator are placing barrels of explosive liquids and detonation packs. Terminator gives Miles a remote control,showing him how they are going to set off the explosions. John enters the lab with the key,telling the rest they got company from about the entire police force. Sarah tells the rest she will finish up,and orders them to go ahead. Terminator says it will take care of the police; John reminds him of his promises,but Terminator reassures him with a simple &quot;Trust me&quot;. The cyborg goes to the front of the building and breaks a window with one of the desks. It ignores the police&apos;s order to surrender,and starts firing rapid shots from the minigun down to the police cars on the ground; the helicopter quickly moves off. Terminator finishes off the remaining cars with the grenade launcher,giving the panicked cops time to flea. Its internal processing screen indicates there are no human casualties. Terminator retreats as the police open heavy fire upon the building. John and Miles reach the vault and open it. John simply breaks the glass cases around the chip fragment and metal arm,indicating that they got &quot;Skynet by the balls&quot;.A heavily armed SWAT team enters the building and proceeds to the second floor,as Sarah and the rest prepare to leave. She gives John the gas masks,he and Terminator leave the room. As Sarah asks Miles for the detonator,the SWAT team bursts inside the lab,opening fire. Sarah takes cover behind a desk,but Miles is hit several times,and sinks to the floor. John tries to get to his mom,but Terminator prevents him from endangering himself. Sarah looks at the mortally injured Miles,who holds the detonator in his hand. With a silent expression,he assures her that he will take care of it. Sarah waits for the SWAT members to reload,fires several shots from her sidearm into the air,and then makes a run for the back of the lab. Glass windows around her break as the SWAT team open fire upon her,and she can narrowly roll herself to cover in the room where the vault is. John is following her escape on a monitor and tells Terminator there is no other exit for her there. With a loud thud,it breaks through the wall and pulls Sarah in through the hole. It breaks a steel door with another blast of its grenade launcher,and the three make their way through a safe corridor to the elevator. The SWAT team advances through the lab towards Miles,who is holding a piece of his chip model above a detonator switch. With heavy dying breaths,he tells the SWAT leader that he doesn&apos;t know how much longer he can hold it up. Realising the imminent danger,the SWAT leader orders his team to pull back immediately. As John,Sarah and Terminator get into the elevator,Miles&apos; rate of breathing becomes slower and slower. Finally,it stops,and he drops the part onto the trigger. An enormous explosion erupts from the building,destroying the entire lab. The elevator comes to an abrupt halt on the first floor. T-1000 arrives on its motor cycle between the burnt-out car wrecks in front of the Cyberdyne building. The elevator doors open,and Terminator checks the lobby,which is full of the SWAT team members. They fire tear gas grenades to the elevator,which forces John and Sarah to buddy-breath with the only remaining gas mask. Terminator tells them to stay there; it will be back. It advances towards the SWAT team,ignoring their leader&apos;s orders to lie down on the floor. They open fire,the bullets ripping pieces of flesh from its metal body,but they cannot stop his advance. As it closes in on them,it uses its sidearm to shoot the men in the legs; it uses the gas grenade launcher to disable the remaining two members. T-1000 drives its motor cycle up one of the staircases of the blown-out building. Terminator exits through the main entrance and fires the remaining gas grenades at the police,disabling the entire force. It relieves two remaining SWAT members of their van (correctly remembering that the keys are tucked behind the sun visor),drives it through the main entrance and picks up John and Sarah. It takes off at high speed as several police officers fire shots at the van. As T-1000 drives through the destroyed lab,it hears the gunshots,seeing the SWAT van leave in the distance. When it notices the helicopter flying near the building,it accelerates,jumps its motor cycle out of the building,and grabs hold of the helicopter,the bike crashing down to the ground. The dumb-struck pilot watches how T-1000 climbs on the canopy,breaks it with its head,liquefies into its amorphous chrome form,pours into the helicopter next to the pilot,and instantly reforms into his previous appearance,telling him to get out; the flabbergasted pilot complies and jumps out. T-1000 quickly lays in pursuit.Meanwhile,in the back of the van,Sarah buries John under a pile of bullet-proof vests,telling him to stay under them,no matter what happens. She also covers the van&apos;s back windows with vests,as she notices the helicopter closing in; Terminator tells her it is T-1000. Sarah and T-1000 exchange automatic weapon fire as Terminator navigates the highway,narrowly missing several cars. It drives under a bridge,but the helicopter simply follows. They pass a large truck which forces T-1000 to fly over another bridge. It quickly gains on the truck,and manages to hit Sarah in the leg. Terminator abruptly stops the van,causing the helicopter to crash into the back of the van; it crumbles and crashes violently onto the road. The crash causes one of the van&apos;s tires to rip,and the van topples over on the road. The driver of the large truck has come to a halt at the crashed helicopter,as a driver from a pick-up truck comes to check on the tipped-over van. The large-truck driver is amazed to see T-1000 appearing unharmed from the wrecked helicopter,but T-1000 simply skewers him with his blade-hand,and mounts the truck. Terminator,John and Sarah stumble from the SWAT van; the pick-up truck driver backs away from Terminators large facial wounds,as it sees the large truck emerging from the smoke several hundred yards back; it reads LIQUID NITROGEN on the side. The three commandeer the pick-up truck as T-1000&apos;s truck rams a stopped car out of the way in the distance. Terminator quickly drives away as T-1000 smashes the remains of the SWAT van out of the way; the pick-up driver can barely get out of the way. John uses a T-shirt from the truck to slow the bleeding from Sarahs leg. Terminator tries to stay ahead,but 60 mps is the pick-up truck&apos;s top speed. As Sarah binds her leg and howls out in pain,the large truck rams into the back of the pick-up. T-1000 gains from the side and tries to crush the pick-up against the side-rail,but another truck coming up ahead forces it to move away. Terminator tells John to take over the wheel,and fires a grenade at the large truck,which takes it slightly off course. Terminator tells John to take the off ramp,but T-1000 still follows. John narrowly misses another truck as Terminator fires another grenade. It hits the truck on the side; the truck rams into the pick-up from behind again,causing Terminator to drop a grenade shell. John drives the truck through the gates of a steel mill,closely followed by T-1000. Terminator grabs its M16 rifle,climbs over onto the hood of T-1000&apos;s truck,empties the entire clip into the liquid android,then turns the wheel quickly to the left,causing the large truck to topple over on its side and slide behind John and Sarah. Terminator holds on to the still moving,tipped-over truck,as John drives through a steel foundry hangar full of workers. The pick-up truck comes to an abrupt halt when it impales itself onto a parked lift-truck,on of its lifters barely passing between John and his mother. As the sliding truck comes screeching into the hangar and crashes against one side of the entrance,Terminator jumps off,rolls himself to safety and comes to a stop against a couple of pipes. The enormous momentum causes the truck to split open in the middle,and liquid nitrogen starts pouring out of the rupture. As the evaporating nitrogen invades the work area,one of the workers sounds the alarm and all workers instantly evacuate. John,Sarah and Terminator watch the T-1000 clambering out of the truck cabin under a pouring rain of liquid nitrogen. As the android appears from the cloud of vapour,it seems to be moving much more sluggish than usual. A layer of frost covers the creaking T-1000 as it attempts to walk,but its feet keep sticking to the floor. Its continuous efforts to walk cause the legs to break off at the ankle and knees. Trying to break its fall with its hand,T-1000 finds the hand frozen to the floor as well. With a violent pull,it breaks free,snapping off its arm to its own astonishment. A few creaking tweaks and turns follow,and it remains motionless. Terminator picks itself up from the floor,points its gun and shoots the frozen android into hundreds of small pieces while saying &quot;hasta la vista,baby&quot;.&#x0A;John gets out of the truck to watch his broken enemy. However,one of the pools of molten metal in the hangar has begun to overflow,and the heat starts to thaw up the frozen pieces. The metal becomes liquid again,and the drops start to coalesce into one big blob. Terminator says there is not much time anymore,and John helps Sarah getting up,as the liquid metal blob is already shaping into the familiar human form again. Terminator reloads its grenade launcher with the shell it dropped earlier,and helps John moving Sarah,when T-1000 is again fully formed and in his normal cop form again. It follows John,Sarah and Terminator on foot as they start going deeper into the steel mill. While holding on to a yellow-black striped bar,the T-1000 notices something very strange: its arm unwillingly mimics the striped pattern of the bar. It pulls the hand loose from the bar,changes it back to normal with a simple flick and starts following its targets again. Terminator leads John and Sarah through the maze of equipment and machinery in the steel mill. As the T-1000 closes,there is a glitch going over its surface. Apparently,it has difficulties in keeping its current form; its feet keep taking on the colour and texture of the metal profiled floor. John,Sarah and Terminator come up at the edge of a molten metal pool,but Sarah can&apos;t stand the heat. They return,but see the T-1000 approaching a few yards ahead. Terminator sends John and Sarah on their way; John wants to stick together,but Terminator firmly tells him to flee. Sarah drags John away while Terminator gets its gun and grenade launcher at the ready. Its internal processing screen searches for the T-1000,which suddenly emerges from the side and kicks away the launcher. There is a nasty and violent fight between the two Terminators,in which they pound each other against the metal surfaces around them. T-1000 is thrown head first against a steel wall,but it quickly morphs itself backwards,ready to fight again. Terminator punches into its head,but its opponent simply liquefies,reforms around Terminators fist,launches it against some more walls,and finally forces its arm between two large cog-wheels. Out of reach,T-1000 takes on its human texture again and leaves Terminator stuck in the machinery.&#x0A;Sarah and John take a few steps towards a platform. Terminator picks up an iron bar and uses it to amputate its arm to free itself. John and Sarah see the T-1000 already coming up to the platform. Sarah lowers John along a chain onto a conveyor belt below,but stays behind herself,despite Johns desperate calls to come along. Sarah reloads her shotgun and fires it at T-1000s head: it leaves a large hole around its right eye,which fills up quickly. It finds out that John has escaped. Before Sarah can reload and fire another shot,T-1000 extends one of its fingers and skewers her left shoulder to the wall. It orders Sarah to call John,but she refuses. It tortures Sarah by moving its finger-blade inside her wounded shoulder,threatens to pierce her head with its other finger,and repeats the order,but she still doesnt comply. At that moment,Terminator takes a slice at T-1000 with the iron bar,almost chopping off its arm and side. But T-1000 kicks Terminator back,mends its body and simply pulls the bar out of it. It starts pounding Terminator with the bar,throwing it in front of a large suspended beam. T-1000 uses the beam to crush Terminator against the wall several times,causing the right eye to come out,and the red robotic eye and metal skull to become exposed. The heavily crushed Terminator attempts to pull itself away with its remaining hand,towards a lower platform where its grenade launcher still rests. But before it can grasp the launcher,T-1000 forces the metal bar into Terminator&apos;s chest,prying in its insides. It retracts the bar again,but before Terminator can make another attempt at the launcher,T-1000 forces the bar all the way through it and the grated floor. Electrical discharges erupt from the metal body,as the red dot in the Terminators eye slowly dies,and its body slowly goes limp.&#x0A;Sarah grabs her shotgun and reloads it with the little remaining strength she has. John crawls out of the conveyor belt tunnel and takes hide behind some equipment. Terminators mechanic eye seems to come back to life again. Its internal processing screen shows that an alternate power route inside the metal body has been found,and the eye becomes fully red. It pulls out the iron bar from its body and the floor,and grabs the grenade launcher.In his hiding place,John hears his mother calling to him. He walks several steps and platforms over to her,to find her limping along the side of a wall. She asks for his help,but then a second Sarah appears behind her,armed with a shotgun. She tells John to get out of the way. John looks down,to see that first Sarah&apos;s feet have seemingly been fused to the grated floor. John yells &quot;shoot!&quot; and a large metal hole appears in first Sarah&apos;s body. In an instant,the wound closes and Sarah morphs back into the familiar cop. Sarah fires a volley of shots at T-1000,which bring him staggering towards the edge of the platform,above one of the molten metal pools. But as he is one step away from falling in,Sarahs shotgun is empty. T-1000 heals his wounds and Sarah fires again,but the gun only clicks. T-1000 makes a childish naughty-gesture with its finger,then starts advancing on John and Sarah. They turn around,to see Terminator emerging on top of a conveyor belt,armed with the grenade launcher. They get down,and Terminator fires his grenade into T-1000&apos;s gut. It gives a look of astonishment before the grenade violently explodes inside; its body is completely burst open,the head and arms hanging from mere threads of iron,as it loses its balance and falls screeching into the pool of molten metal. The effect is devastating: as John and Sarah watch,the T-1000 splashes and thrashes in the pool,screaming in agony,uncontrollably morphing through the forms it previously adapted: the police man,Janelle Voight,Lewis the guard,the motorcycle police man. Desperately screaming and fighting against a destructive force,several more heads and arms pop out of its body in desperation. It takes the rough shape of a giant open-mouthed head that turns inside-out,before it finally returns into a terrified face that dissolves in the metal.John helps up the Terminator,which looks like a wrecked car and says it needs a vacation. They look at the molten pool and John asks if it is dead. Terminator replies that it is terminated. John throws the metal arm and the chip in the steel. Sarah sighs that it is over,but Terminator reminds her that there is still one more chip which must be destroyed; it points at its skull. It hands Sarah a remote control for one of the electrically operated pulleys,saying that it cannot self-terminate and needs to be lowered in the molten steel. Sarah looks confused,but John can&apos;t accept this,and desperately pleads to the Terminator to stay with them. When it apologizes and tells that it has to do it,John tearfully orders it not to go. Terminator remains silent for a while,looking John in the eyes,and tells him it knows now why he cries; but it is something it can never do. John hugs the cyborg,it shakes Sarahs outstretched hand,and then holds on to one of the chains. Sarah activates the pulley,lowering the Terminator down into the pool. Its clothes burn as it slowly melts away from below in the hot steel. It looks up to John,who is in tears. After the hot metal immerses the face,its hand does a final thumb-up before it sinks in the hot metal. There is a last look into its internal processing screen,which goes static,and finally blacks out like a TV screen. Sarah drops the remote and holds the sobbing John to her shoulder. We see the camera flying over the highway at night again,as Sarah speaks: &quot;The unknown future rolls towards us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine,a Terminator,can learn the value of human life,maybe we can too.&quot;&#x0A;Fade out. Credits start rolling while playing the Terminator theme music,and Guns &apos;N Roses,&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;. Special Edition Credits</Plot>

        <Plot>Following the events of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;,John Connor (Nick Stahl) has been living off-the-grid in Los Angeles. Although Judgment Day did not occur on August 29,1997,the date given by the Terminator in the previous film,John does not believe that the prophesied war between humans and Skynet has been averted. Unable to locate John,Skynet sends a new model of Terminator,the T-X (Kristanna Loken),back in time to July 24,2004 to kill his future lieutenants in the human Resistance. A more advanced model than previous Terminators,the T-X has an endoskeleton with built-in weaponry,a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000,and the ability to control other machines. The Resistance sends a reprogrammed T-850 model 101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to protect the T-X&apos;s targets,including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and John. This Terminator reveals that in the future John and Kate are married,and that it successfully killed John in 2032 before being reprogrammed by Kate.The Terminator saves John and Kate from the T-X&apos;s attack,and the three visit the grave of Sarah Connor,who died of leukemia some years before. Inside the grave they find a weapons cache left by Sarah&apos;s friends as a backup in the event that Judgment Day was not averted. The T-X and police arrive and a battle ensues,but John,Kate,and the Terminator manage to steal a hearse and escape. The Terminator has been programmed to take John and Kate to a safe location so that they may survive Judgment Day,which is to occur in a few hours,but John decides that they should attempt to prevent Skynet from being activated. After the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems in Terminator 2: Judgment Day,the United States Air Force took over the Skynet project and it is being headed by Kate&apos;s father,Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (David Andrews). However,the trio arrive too late to stop him from activating Skynet in an attempt to stop the spread of a massive computer virus. Skynet assumes control of the military&apos;s defense network just as the T-X arrives,taking control of various machines including T-1s in an attempt to eliminate John and Kate. John asks the dying General for the location of Skynet&apos;s system core,hoping to still stop Judgment Day,and is instructed to go to Crystal Peak,a military base built into the Sierra Nevada mountains.Before John and Kate can escape by plane,the T-X takes control of the Terminator and it attacks them. It is able to override its programming and shut itself down just before killing John. As John and Kate arrive at Crystal Peak they are attacked by the T-X,but a rebooted Terminator crashes a helicopter into it. Even with its legs severed the T-X continues to pursue John and Kate,but the Terminator traps it under a blast door and detonates its last remaining hydrogen fuel cell in the T-X&apos;s mouth,destroying them both. John and Kate discover that Crystal Peak does not house Skynet&apos;s core,but is rather a Cold War-era fallout shelter for high-ranking government officials. General Brewster sent them there to protect them from the impending nuclear holocaust initiated by Skynet. Skynet in fact does not have a core but instead exists as software in cyberspace running on computers all over the world,making it effectively impossible to shut down. It begins a series of nuclear attacks on various cities,commencing Judgment Day. Soon after the attacks the equipment at Crystal Peak picks up transmissions from amateur radio operators and Montana&apos;s civil defense,to which John responds.</Plot>

        <Plot>In 2003,Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign his body over for medical research following his execution by lethal injection. One year later,the Skynet system is activated,perceives humans as a threat to its own existence,and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as Judgment Day (see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines). In 2018,John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue,but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. However,Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside),the current leader,of his discovery. Meanwhile,the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days,in response to an intercepted &quot;kill list&quot; indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance&apos;s command staff in four days&apos; time. John learns that his own name is second on the list,following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle&apos;s importance to Skynet,but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father (see The Terminator). John meets with his officer Barnes (Common) and wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and sends radio broadcasts to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles,Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and his mute companion Star (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle relates to Marcus the events of Judgment Day and the ensuing war between humans and machines. Hearing John&apos;s radio broadcast,the three leave Los Angeles in search of the Resistance. They survive an attack by machines,but Kyle,Star,and several other humans are taken prisoner,while a pair of Resistance A-10s are shot down. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to John&apos;s base,but Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life,the Resistance fighters discover that he is in fact a cyborg with human organs,a mechanical endoskeleton,circuitry,and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Marcus believes himself to be human,demanding to be released so that he can save Kyle from Skynet,but John orders his destruction. However,Blair releases him and helps him to escape from the base. During the resulting pursuit Marcus saves John&apos;s life from Skynet hydrobots,and the two form an alliance. Marcus will enter Skynet&apos;s headquarters and attempt to disable its defenses so that John can rescue Kyle.John demands that Ashdown delay the attack so that he can rescue Kyle and the other prisoners,but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However,John&apos;s soldiers remain loyal to him and he sends a radio broadcast asking the other Resistance fighters not to attack Skynet. Meanwhile,Marcus enters the Skynet base and interfaces with the computer,disabling the perimeter defenses and allowing John to infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners. The Resistance&apos;s disabling signal is revealed to be a ruse,and the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard is destroyed by a Hunter-Killer.Marcus discovers that he was created by Skynet and has unwittingly fulfilled his programmed mission to lure John into the base to be killed. He tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and leaves to assist John in battling a T-800 model 101 Terminator. John is mortally wounded during the fight,but succeeds in destroying the Skynet base by rigging several Terminator nuclear power cells to an explosive,detonating them as he,Marcus,Kyle,and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John&apos;s life,but his heart is too damaged. Marcus offers his heart for transplant,sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering,John radios to the other Resistance fighters that though this battle has been won,the war is far from over. [D-Man2010]</Plot>

        <Plot>The film starts on a small cul-de-sac in the midwest. Late one evening,Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) is unable to sleep,and a strange noise from the house next door causes him to go outside. However,Ray just stares at the rather unkempt house as a mysterious wind blows dead leaves around his feet,and several more unexplained noises are heard.The next day,Ray&apos;s wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) is non-plussed that Ray has chosen to spend his week&apos;s vacation just sitting around the house doing nothing. She attempts to convince Ray to take her and their 10-year-old son Dave (Cory Danziger) up to a nearby lake for a fishing retreat,but Ray refuses to do so. Suddenly,the sound of gunshots are heard in the backyard,and Ray sees his overweight and immature neighbor Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) shooting at some crows with a shotgun.Art then invites himself into the Peterson&apos;s home for breakfast,and explains that his wife (who is away for a few weeks visting her parents) wants the crows taken care of. The crows seem have just shown up recently. Talk soon switches to the neighboring house to the right of the Peterson&apos;s. The previous neighbors,an elderly couple known as &quot;The Knapps,&quot; have supposedly sold their property to a family going by the name of Klopek. Art eerily explains how the realtor who sold the Klopeks their new home,said their last house burnt to the ground. Art also claims that so far,the Klopeks have not seemed at all neighborly,given that no one has seen them since they moved in several weeks ago. Dave then explains that he saw three of them with his telescope... digging in their back yard one night.After breakfast,Ray opens up the garage,and Art notes that one of the Klopeks,a scruffy red-headed young man,(Courtney Gaines) is standing on the porch. Both egg the other on to say &quot;Hi,&quot; but the unnamed stranger quickly goes back inside the house. Next,the two decide to go over and ring the doorbell. This causes a chain reaction that causes a lamp to be knocked aside,revealing a hidden beehive that chases off Ray and Art.Later that evening,Ray goes over to Art&apos;s place where he also encounters Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman),a teenager on the block whose parents are away. As strange noises begin to eminate from the Klopek&apos;s house,Art tells the story of a Soda Fountain owner long ago known as Skip. One day,a strange odor began eminating from Skip&apos;s house,and eventually,a fire broke out. When the firemen went inside,they found that the local Soda Fountain owner had murdered his family with an ice pick,and stored them in the basement. Art eerily explains that: &quot;almost every town has some strange mystery like that... some of which may be happening right under your nose.&quot;Ray soon tires of Art&apos;s antics and goes back inside to watch television. But soon after,Art gets Ray to come back out,where they meet up with Lt. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern),a militarist Vietnam veteran who lives across the street from the Klopek&apos;s. Rumsfield has given the men use of an infrared nightscope,and they take up position behind Rumsfield&apos;s garbage cans. As they watch the house,a strange noise is head,and bright lights flash from under the house&apos;s porch,before a rank odor permeates the air.Ray is about to go across the street and figure out what&apos;s going on,when suddenly,the garage door on the Klopek&apos;s house opens up,and the three men see a car pull out,and the scruffy man they saw before emerges. He then pulls out several trash bags,and attempts to stuff them into the already full garbage cans,using a stick. Once the car pulls back into the garage,a rain storm hits,and Rumsfield says they&apos;ll investigate what is in the cans further once &quot;first light&quot; comes around. Later that evening,Ray looks out his bedroom window,and sees three hooded figures in the Klopek&apos;s backyard,digging large holes.The next day,Rumsfield and Art stop the garbage men (Dick Miller and Robert Picardo) from taking the Klopek&apos;s trash and dump the trash into the street,but they find nothing in the black plastic bags. Ray then explains what he saw through the rain-streaked window last night. Art then claims that the supposed bodies that were in the trash bags were taken out in the rain,and buried in the backyard when the guy who drove the car saw them.Soon after,Rumsfield&apos;s young blonde floozy wife Bonnie (Wendy Schaal) finds Queenie,a little dog belonging to an elderly and grouchy neighbor named Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon). The group goes over to Walter&apos;s house,but when he doesn&apos;t answer the door,Rumsfield uses a glass-cutter to enter,and they find the television still on,and a chair turned over. Further investigation leads the group to the kitchen,where Walter&apos;s toupee is found on a counter. Rumsfield immediately suspects foul play,but Ray demands everyone leave the house. Ray keeps Queenie at his place,and leaves a little note for Walter,which simply reads: &quot;Walter,I have your dog.&quot; As he slides the note under Walter&apos;s door,Ray glances towards the Klopek&apos;s house,and sees an old man (Brother Theodore) watching him from the Klopek&apos;s second floor window. When Ray says a greeting,the old man quickly shuts the window.That evening,Ray and Art meet in the basement of Ray&apos;s house,where Art has found a book on demon worship and Satanic sacrifices. Art insists that the Klopeks are Satanists,but Ray refuses to believe this. The conversation soon leads Ray to have a nightmare in which he is served up as a sacrifice.The next morning,Art and Rumsfield slide a note under the Klopek&apos;s door and ring the bell,before running off. When Art tells Ray about this,Ray panics,thinking that the Klopek&apos;s now suspect that he slid the note under the door,given the old Klopek man saw him do it to Walter&apos;s house the previous day. The conversation soon stops when Ray&apos;s dog returns with a bone,that Art soon classifies as a femur,or a human thigh-bone. Art thinks that the bone is Walter. Ray and Art scream until they see a figure behind the fence of the Klopek house (the old man) walking in the Klopek back yard who throws a crumpled up piece of paper into the back yard of Ray&apos;s house. Art goes to look at the paper and says that it is his note that he wrote. Ray panics more,thinking that he is now a marked man,while the immature Art does not think the same.Soon after,Carol and Bonnie feel that the guys in the neighborhood are acting childish. Carol proposes a simple solution: everyone will go over,knock on the door,and talk to these new neighbors. Due to Art being one of the more off-the-cuff persons,he is not invited.Ray,Carol,Rumsfield and Bonnie go over to the Klopeks where they meet Hans (the scruffy young man Ray first saw on the porch and driving the car). Minutes later Reuben (the old man Ray saw looking at him from the window) whom is Hans&apos; uncle,soon enters. He is very cold and hostile around the guests,especially Ray. Soon after,Werner Klopek (Henry Gibson) enters to meet their guests. Ray is very nervous thinking that the Klopeks will do something to him now that he is in their house.During drinks,Werner is the more friendly and hospitable of the three. He explains that he his a practicing pathologist at a local university and his older brother Reuben (a retired college professor) and nephew Hans (a college dropout) have been traveling with him from place to place for years during his work. Werner explains that they will be driving to the university tomorrow because they will soon be transferring out of the current university he works at,and the family will be moving again. When the extremely wary Ray accidentally spills tea on himself,he runs and accidently opens the basement door,only to have the Klopek&apos;s huge Great Dane dog come barreling out,and into the backyard... where it quickly spots Art,who had tried to sneak in through the back of the house. The dog chases Art off,but not before he sets off a burglar alarm.The group leaves the Klopeks and go to the Peterson&apos;s house. While Art and Rumsfield still see the Klopek&apos;s as psychos and they are hiding something,Ray (who is now strangely calm) claims he agrees with Carol and Bonnie that the Klopeks are all right. Ray then ushers the two men into his study,and then reveals something he found at the Klopeks: Walter&apos;s toupee. Ray explains that he had slipped the toupee back inside Walter&apos;s house the previous day,but when the dog came out of the Klopek&apos;s basement and everyone was out on the back porch while the dog was chasing Art,Ray found the toupee in the Klopek living room wedged in a stack of mail... all of them addressed to Walter. This leads the three to believe that the Klopeks are trying to cover their murderous trail. Ray explains that the Werner had mentioned that they would all be going to the University the next day,and the three plot to investigate the Klopek&apos;s house and back yard,intent on finding Walter&apos;s corpse.The next day,after Mark Rumsfield watches the Klopeks,along with their dog,drive away,he gets ready by putting on military fatigues and arming himself with an assault rifle. At the same time,Ray sends his wife and son off to visit her sister,claiming that he and Art are going to go and play golf later on in the day. Carol is clearly suspicious to Ray&apos;s sudden change in behavior,but leaves anyway. Once they are gone,the three men leap into action. They first attempt to disable the Klopek&apos;s alarm system by disabling the power to their house which activates the trip-wires around their backyard fence. When Art,dressed as a maintenance man,climbes up a poll to cut the power,he accidently cuts the main circut cable for the entire block (and probally the whole neighborhood) and gets electricuted and falls from the poll,but the power to the Klopek alarms is disabled anyway. While Rumsfield sets up a &quot;command post&quot; on top of the roof of his house to watch for the Klopeks in case they return,Ray and Art scale the back fence of the Klopeks back yard and begin digging all around the yard looking for any dead bodies.Meanwhile,Ricky,seeing the action unfolding before him,calls several of his friends and they come on over to watch the events unfolding as if watching a drive-in movie. Rumsfield is annoyed by the literal party in the front yard of Ricky&apos;s house next door.As the day wears into the hot summer afternoon,Ray and Art,after having dug several holes in the Klopek&apos;s back yard where Ray supposedly saw them digging,finds nothing. Ray suggests they check inside the house. Finding the back door locked,the frustrated but determined Ray breaks a back window and unlocks the back door. The two of them venture to the basement where they find a large old furnace. When Art turns it on,it creates a blast of flames which makes them realize that the furnace (with a termostat temperature of 5,000 F degrees) is no ordinary furance. Ray suspects that after killing Walter,the Klopeks burned his body up in the furnace and buried the bones in a patch of earth ground of the basement. Ray and Art again begin digging the ground of the basement to look for the body. Ray continues digging for a few more horus as he hits ground water and then finds something metal when he hits with his his pick axe.As nigthtfall comes,Rumsfield,still on the roof of his house,notices a car pulling up in Walter&apos;s driveway where a middle aged couple gets out and to his shock,a frail-looking Walter,using a walker,exits the car. Ricky,watching from his front porch and Art,exiting the Klopek house from the front door into the street,also see Walter alive and well and are all in shock. But none of them notice the three Klopeks returning to their house. Seeing the lights from the basement on when the whole neighborhood is dark,they quietly drive away and return a few minutes later followed by a police car,which they are then spotted. Rumsfield tries to warn Ray on the CB radio he has,but Ray is still frantically digging and doesn&apos;t hear Rumsfield&apos;s warning. Art runs back inside the Klopek house to warn Ray,while Ricky tries to stall the Klopeks and the police by literally jumping in front of their cars to get them to stop.When Ray finally tries to clear the ground water away from his find,he hts it again with the pick axe and bubbles start appearing in the groundwater and he realizes that he just hit the underground methane gas line and he warns Art to run when he returns to the basement. Ray struggles to get out of the hole as the gas begins flooding the whole house... while the Klopek furnance is still running. Outside,as Ricky and Rumsfield try to stall the Klopeks and the policeman from entering their house,Art runs outside yelling that they hit a gas pipe when seconds later the entire Klopek house explodes in which the spire of their roof lands on the policeman&apos;s car. Thinking that Ray is dead,Art is revealed when a partly burned Ray emerges from the burning Klopek house.Some hours later,Carol arrives back home to check up on Ray and sees fire trucks,ambulances,and a huge crowd in front of the Klopek house. Carol finds the shaken Ray being treated for his injuries. Nearby,Art talks to a police detective (Franklin Ajay) who tells Art that Walter was at the hospital for the last three days when on Monday night he apparently had a heart attack in which he called his daughter and son-in-law who live a few miles away where they took him to the hospital. The reason why Walter&apos;s mail and toupee were in the Klopek house when Ray found them is that Walter&apos;s son phoned the Klopeks to ask them to pick up Walter&apos;s mail in which the toupee got mixed up with the rest of the mail when Ray sliped it back through the mail slot of Walter&apos;s house.While Art claims that sooner or later the rest of the skeleton to the femur bone will be found eventually,Ray explodes at him claiming that because they never found anything,that the Klopeks really are innocent of any crimes and they have been really immature and over reactive the entire time. When Art still fails to comprehend Ray&apos;s explanation,he attacks Art,and has to be retrained. Angry and exhausted,Ray gets into on an ambulance strecher and demands that they take him to the hospital for fruther treatment of his injuries.While in the ambulance,Werner Klopek enters,but he is now suddenly cold and suspicious to Ray. Werner tells Ray that he may have fooled Art and the others with his speech about Klopeks,but he cannot fool him. Ray doesn&apos;t know what Werner is talking about,and the doctor mentions about Ray investigating his basement and found a skull in the furance (which Ray didn&apos;t prior to Art turning the furnace on). Werner thinks that Ray knows all about the bones and the skull in the furance and tells Ray that the femur bone that he found indeed belonged to a murder victim whom was Mr. Knapp. Werner tells Ray that they took the house and killed both Mr. and Mrs. Knapp after they refused to sell it to the Klopeks and they apparently cooked the bodies and ate them... implying that the Klopeks are a practicing cannibal cult.Ray makes an attempt to escape,but realizes that Hans is driving the ambulance as Werner attempts to stab Ray with a hypodermic needle to kill him. In the struggle,Ray manages to grab at Hans who loses control of the ambulance and attempting to avoid hiting a pizza delivery van,runs the ambulance into Art&apos;s house at the end of the street. The ambulance back doors fling open and the strecher with Ray and Werner still struggling on it falls out and rolls down the street which ends when they hit the Klopek&apos;s car still parked outside the remains of their burned-out house in which the car trunk pops open. Now with witnesses around,Ray claims that the Klopeks are indeed murderers and part of a cannibal cult. Ricky happens by and points out to everyone that the trunk of the Klopeks car is filled with hundreds of human bones and a few dozen human skulls. (It is implied that most of the bones belong to human bodies stolen by the Klopeks from morgues and various college pathology labs for personal consumption) The police arrest Werner and Reuben,but Hans is nowhere to be found. Rumsfield finds Hans attempting to escape,but chases him and captures him.With Ray in the clear and the fire trucks and police leaving the scene,Ray and Carol are glad that he is all right and they agree to leave tomorrow to take the remainder of Ray&apos;s vacation at the lake. When Art approaches and tells them about the media circus comming to the neighborhood over the next few days to investigate the &apos;Klopek Cannibal Cult&apos;,Ray and Carol are not intrested in staying around. Just then,Mark and Bonnie Rumsefield tell Art that his wife is home early and his house is on fire from the damage caused by the ambulance still lodged in the front door of his house. Art is shocked and devastated... but its mostly about his wife being home.While Art goes to try to explain what is going on to his wife,the fire trucks return to try to put out the fire to Art&apos;s house. With another crowd gathering to watch the action,Ray and Carol go to their house unnoticed,except by Ricky in which Ray tells him to &quot;keep an eye on the neighborhood&quot; while he is away for his vacation. Ricky agrees as Ray and Carol enter their house for the night. Ricky,breaking the fourth wall,looks at the viewers and replies&quot; God,I love this street!&quot; He then goes back to talking to his friends as well as the two garbage men as the image backs away from the street,and area to an overhead view from space as to where the movie began.</Plot>

        <Plot>In her film debut, Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron, a pop music superstar. It seems that one of her fans is stalking her and has threatened to kill her, so Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a professional bodyguard and former Secret Service agent, is hired to protect her.The film then follows Rachel Marron&apos;s life from performance to performance. Each performance features her singing a song (including Houston&apos;s hits I Will Always Love You and I Have Nothing) that reflects her emotional state. Frank Farmer successfully protects her from danger. Subsequently, and possibly as a result of his protection and the trust thus inspired, Rachel Marron falls in love with Frank, and, though he tries to keep their relationship professional, they sleep together. However, recognizing that their relationship puts her and her family in danger, he breaks-off the affair and heightens moves to protect her (many such previous moves were shot down by Rachel). Ironically, in an effort to separate Rachel from her own world, Frank introduces Rachel to his own father and personal life. As the story follows a number of potential stalkers, Rachel must put her trust in Frank ahead of her own selfishness and desire for success; as Frank must face the fact that the threat may not be what was expected. In the end, Frank&apos;s duty is fulfilled, having successfully protected Rachel, and they part with a kiss. Frank then moves on to his next assignment...to protect an archbishop.</Plot>

        <Plot>This film opens with mass in a Boston Catholic church,where Irish American fraternal twin brothers Connor McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy McManus (Norman Reedus) pray while a sermon is read,mentioning Kitty Genovese,a real-life crime victim brutally murdered while her neighbors watched without intervening. As the priest begins his homily,the brothers approach the altar and kiss the feet of a crucifix. They depart as the priest reminds the congregation that they should fear not just evil but also the &quot;indifference of good men&quot;. The brothers conclude that the priest finally understands,Connor stating,&quot;I do believe the Monsignor&apos;s finally got the point...&quot; and Murphy replying,&quot;Aye&quot;.Connor and Murphy work at a local meatpacking plant. While celebrating St. Patrick&apos;s Day in a neighborhood bar,three Russian &quot;soldiers&quot;,led by Ivan Checkov,enter and order everyone to leave,as their organization has decided to evict the pub. In the ensuing bar brawl,Connor,Murphy,and the patrons publicly humiliate the mobsters,who the next day ambush the brothers in their home. As Murphy is dragged into a nearby alley to be executed,Connor escapes to the roof and drops a toilet,along with himself,off the roof and onto the mobsters,killing them and rescuing Murphy.The Russian mob&apos;s involvement summons FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) to the murder case,and he surmises that the mobsters&apos; death was not a professional hit but self-defense. As the police begin a manhunt for the killers,Connor and Murphy arrive at the police station to clear their names. During the initial interrogation,the brothers impress Smecker with their multilingualism (including Gaelic,Russian,French,Spanish,Italian,and German) while recalling the specifics of the barfight and subsequent self-defense the next morning. Smecker believes their story and allows them to stay overnight in a holding cell to evade the press. That night,Connor and Murphy receive a vision from God telling them to destroy all that is evil so that which is good may flourish.The brothers resolve to rid Boston of &quot;evil men&quot; with the help of their friend and former mob package boy David &quot;The Funnyman&quot; Della Rocco (David Della Rocco). The brothers trade in the weapons and valuables stolen from the mobsters&apos; bodies for their own,and use Connor&apos;s knowledge of Russian to locate a meeting between Russian syndicate bosses at a local hotel. Crashing into the room through an overhead air duct,the brothers draw their guns and fire,killing the 8 underbosses. Forcing the leader,Yuri &apos;Big Man&apos; Petrova (Victor Pedtrchenko) to his knees,the brothers recite a short prayer:&quot;And shepherds we shall be,for Thee,my Lord,for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomine Patris,et Filii,et Spirits Sancti.&quot;The two then execute him,placing pennies over his eye sockets,in which both of his eyes were shot out. While the brothers are preparing to leave the hotel,they are surprised to find Rocco dressed as a bellboy knocking at the door with a tray of food. They decided &quot;to fuck with him&quot; and pull him into the hotel,concealing their identity with masks,and threaten to execute him. Eventually they reveal their identity to Rocco,who decides to join the brothers in their mission. Once again,Agent Smecker is brought to the front of the murder case. The fact that all the killings involved the Russian Mob leads Smecker to the theory that the executions were the result of the feud between the Russian and Italian mobs.The following day,the brothers try to convince Rocco that he was sold out by Italian mob boss Papa Joe Yakavetta (Carlo Rota),because he was sent to the hotel with a six-shooter .38 revolver despite the fact there were nine mobsters in the hotel room. Rocco soon realizes this after killing two of Yakavetta&apos;s men at a deli later on,who hint to Rocco that he really was sold out. In retaliation,Rocco and the brothers hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lipazzi (Ron Jeremy),underboss of the Yakavetta crime family at a local strip club. Also killed at the Strip Club are two street criminals with no connection to organized crime (thus disproving Smecker&apos;s mob war theory). The three vigilantes proceed on a series of increasingly violent missions,cleansing the city of vicious criminals and others who have eluded justice. Papa Joe,believing that the mob killings are an act of revenge from Rocco for setting him up to be killed,contracts the infamous contract killer Il Duce (Billy Connolly),to deal with the vengeful package boy.Rocco insist that he and the brothers murder a hitman that Rocco had briefly worked with. According to Rocco,the man was responsible for murdering an entire family and had burnt their remains in a dumpster. They head to the hitman&apos;s house and murder all of his men. After a hand-to-hand fight,Rocco beats the hitman to death with a cue ball. As they leave the hitman&apos;s house through the front door,the trio is ambushed by Il Duce,and in the resulting shootout the trio manage to chase Il Duce away. Rocco&apos;s finger is shot off and each of the brothers receive serious,but not mortal,gunshot wounds which they cauterize with a hot iron.Hours later at the crime scene,Smecker discovers the finger and secretly takes it to conduct his own investigation. Discovering that it belongs to Rocco,whom he previously met,Smecker begins to unravel the mystery surrounding the various murders. His sympathy for the brothers conflicting with his professional desire to bring them to justice,Smecker (a flamboyant homosexual) goes on a drinking binge at a gay bar before seeking advice from a nearby Catholic church. Bemoaning the futility of the courts that fail to punish evil men and his uncertainty with the MacManus brothers&apos; actions in a confessional,Smecker is oblivious to the fact that Rocco,who has tracked Smecker to the church,is forcefully directing the priest&apos;s responses to preserve the Boondock Saints&apos; identities. Connor sees Rocco follow the priest into the confessional and,disgusted with the blasphemy,pulls Rocco&apos;s head through the other confessional at gun point. In whispered tones,Rocco tries to explain to Connor the circumstance while still holding his gun to the priest&apos;s head. Smecker is advised,reluctantly by the priest,that the Saint&apos;s are acting as messengers from God and that &quot;the laws of God are greater than the laws of man.&quot; Inspired by the advice,Smecker decides to help the brothers.The McManus brothers and Rocco infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family,but are captured by Papa Joe and his henchmen who recently arrived to protect Papa Joe from such an attack. Papa Joe executes Rocco to intimidate the brothers. The brothers manage to free themselves and tend to Rocco while Smecker,disguised as a female prostitute,distracts the other mobsters. Smecker kills the remaining mobsters only to be knocked unconscious by Il Duce who mistakes Smecker for a woman. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco,Il Duce arrives and sneaks up behind them.As he hears them recite the family prayer,and upon seeing that the man he was hired to kill (Rocco) is dead,he lowers his weapons and joins them. It becomes apparent that Il Duce is their long-lost father,as the brothers had previously refused to teach Rocco the prayer because it is only passed down in their family. He then joins them in their mission to rid the city of evildoers.Three months later Papa Joe is sent to trial,and though there seems to be enough evidence to convict him,the reporters on scene anticipate his acquittal due to his Gotti-esque charisma. The trial is forcibly interrupted when the two brothers and Il Duce,aided by Agent Smecker and several police officers,infiltrate and lock down the courtroom. The three then publicly declare their mission to destroy evil and recite their prayer one last time,killing Papa Joe with several bullets (and a shotgun blast) to the back of the head. The media dubs the three &quot;Saints&quot;,and the movie ends with various &quot;man-on-the-street&quot; interviews in which various Boston citizens reflect on the question &quot;Are the Saints ultimately good,or evil?&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>Julie Miller (Erica Durance) and her boyfriend,Nick Larson (Eric Lively),are celebrating Julie&apos;s 24th birthday on a camping trip with another couple,Trevor Eastman (Dustin Milligan) and Amanda (Gina Holden). Nick and Julie walk away from the campsite for a bit of privacy,and she begins to tell him something important but he interrupts her with her birthday present. They begin to discuss their future together,with Nick telling her that his job will make him successful enough for the both of them,and he asks her not to move to New York to pursue her photography. Nick is called away by work before Julie can tell him her important news. He says that he has to go to the meeting,even though it is Sunday,because he is up against co-worker Dave Bristol (David Lewis) for a promotion. The four friends have to cut their trip short and drive back to the city in Nick&apos;s SUV. Julie is taking photographs while Nick is driving. When she unbuckles her seatbelt to snap a picture of Trevor and Amanda kissing in the backseat,the tire suddenly blows out and the SUV spins out of control,finally stalling in the middle of the road where a semi-truck smashes into them.Nick lies in a hospital bed unconscious,having flashbacks of the accident,when he appears to start seizing. At his side is his mother,who informs the nurse that he is having one of his nightmares,an occasional occurrence since childhood. He awakens to learn the others did not survive the crash.Back home,Nick grieves over memories of Julie&apos;s birthday,and he brings the birthday necklace he gave her to the scene of the accident (where a roadside memorial has been built). Later while looking at a photograph of himself and Julie,everything in the room begins to shudder and shake,while the people and the dog in the photograph begin moving. This effect is similar to the pre-timetravel effect in the first movie,but Nick drops the framed picture on the floor where it shatters and he does not travel through time.One year later,Nick is shown back at his job with Bristol as his supervisor (he obviously got the aforementioned promotion over Dave). Bristol treats Nick with no respectpretending he can&apos;t find the work that Nick stayed late the previous night to finish and making him redo the work,moving an important meeting where Nick is to present a sales pitch without telling Nick until the last moment,and snapping at Nick about his supposed messy desk. While presenting the sales pitch to investors for his company&apos;s &quot;nextgen software for handhelds&quot;,Nick begins to get another slight episode of his environment becoming unstable and rattling after seeing an old photograph which includes Trevor. This ruins his sales pitch and he is called in to meet with the company&apos;s boss,Ron (Andrew Airlie),and given a week&apos;s suspension.Back home,Nick is looking at photographs from Julie&apos;s 24th birthday when he comes across a picture of him driving everyone home. He transports back to the moments just before the tire blew. He yells at Julie to buckle-up,and the tire blows as before,but this time they manage to avoid the semi-truck,running into a tree instead.Nick awakens on the floor in a new shirt. Julie is now living with him,and he is pleasantly surprised to see her. It is her 25th birthday and they go out to dinner where he tells her that he remembers the past year differently. Trevor and Amanda arrive,and Nick gives them both a hug,pleased to see them. He learns that they are going to marry,and he is Trevor&apos;s best man,in charge of the bachelor party.The next day at work,Nick is researching on-line,trying to determine why he doesn&apos;t remember the last year in the same manner as everyone else. He prints out an article about a mental hospital patient with a syndrome that appears to be similar to what he has been experiencing. The patient is Jason Treborn,Evan Treborn&apos;s (Ashton Kutcher) father in the first movie.At a staff meeting,he learns that Trevor has been fired. When Nick accuses his supervisor of using Trevor as a scapegoat for a sales deal that fell through,he too is fired. Julie is angry with him,reminding him that she could have moved to New York if not for him. Now she has a minimum wage job,and she refers to what they lost from the accident. Nick tells her he understands now what is important in life: that they both are together.Later,Nick sees a Christmas photograph of him,his friends,and his supervisor,Dave,on the fridge. He takes a closer look at the photo while venting some frustration. An episode (his environment becoming unstable and rattling) is triggered,and suddenly he has gone into the photo&apos;s scene and he is at the party. Nick sees Dave,fakes tripping so he is able to spill wine on him,and then goes to Dave&apos;s file cabinet and steals the file of a specific investor (earlier Nick mentioned Dave got his promotion off the work Nick did).Nick is suddenly in an alternate timeline where he is now the vice-president of the company. He phones Julie,getting her answering machine,with her message revealing she owns a local photography studio. Nick leaves her a message to meet him that night after he finishes a sale pitch meeting. Nick gives a successful pitch at the meeting,and he learns he is having an affair with the boss&apos; daughter when she follows him into the men&apos;s toilets. She uses Nick&apos;s handheld to take a photograph of him kissing her.When Nick gets back to his place,Trevor is waiting to tell him that a deal with a shady investor named Malcolm is in trouble. Nick tells his friend he will fix things,and then asks about Julie. Trevor replies that he has not kept in touch with her since Nick broke up with her a few months back.Nick learns the next day at work that the sales pitch to the investor the previous night did not go through. He relays to Ron,his boss,that Malcolm wants his investment money back. His boss informs him the company is broke,and it is Nick&apos;s fault. Nick was unable to get a crucial investor several months ago,the one from the file he stole at Christmas from Dave (who was able to secure the investment in a previous timeline). Nick continues his attempts to contact Julie.Nick and Trevor are at Malcolm&apos;s nightclub to discuss matters with him when Nick spots Julie taking photographs of the fashion show. She wants nothing to do with him and has a new boyfriend. Nick tells Malcolm he is unable to return the money,and Malcolm has Trevor killed. Nick runs out of the room being shot at,when a stray bullet hits Julie and she dies. Nick attempts to escape using the photo taken earlier by the boss&apos; daughter,but he fails and is knocked out and captured. Nick wakes up and finds he is being given fellatio,only to discover that it is Malcolm&apos;s gay business partner.Nick escapes trouble and goes back in time where he confesses everything to his mom. She tells him his father also tried to control things and committed suicide in the end. Nick meets with Amanda who has with her a photograph from Julie&apos;s 24th birthday,which he had asked her to bring.Nick transports to the scenes from the start of the movie. He tells Julie she should move to New York and breaks up with her. Julie tells him she is having his baby,but he remains with his back to her and doesn&apos;t respond. Upset,Julie takes his SUV and speeds down the road. Nick then steals a jeep from another camping couple. Nick chases after her in the jeep and pulls alongside her (in the wrong lane) to urge her to stop the SUV. When an oncoming vehicle approaches in the lane,Nick drives off the road and over the edge of the cliff,presumably dying.One year later. Julie lives in New York with her son,Nick junior. Nick junior has a slight episode of his environment becoming unstable and rattling while looking at the 24th birthday photograph of his parents and their friends,which is left in a changed state.</Plot>

        <Plot>In this movie sequel,Vin Diesel returns as Riddick,an escaped convict with a price on his head. Riddick has been hiding on a snow planet for the last five years,when a group of mercenaries try to capture him. Riddick returns to the planet Helion,and finds out that his friend Jack,is in prison on Crematoria,a very hot planet. While on Helion,the planet is invaded by the Necromongers,led by Lord Marshal (Colm Feore),who wants to rule the universe. Riddick is captured by the mercs and flown to the same unsavoury and possibly illegal prison Kyra is in. Turns out Jack is now known as Kyra (Alexa Davalos) and is tough as nails. The mercs and the prison guards can&apos;t agree on the bounty to be paid for Riddick. When the guards learn that a Necro ship has followed the mercs to the planet,tension boils over and the guards and mercs shoot it out. Following the battle,Riddick,Kyra,and the other prisoners escape. They realize the guards have deserted them and are attempting to escape the Necros; they head out across the surface of Crematoria hoping to beat the guards to the escape ship. Meanwhile,the Necro Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) speaks with Aerion (Dame Judi Dench),an air Elemental capable of seeing into the future in some limited way but now imprisoned by the Necros. Aerion reveals that The Lord Marshal previously tried to exterminate the race of Furians because of a prophecy which foretold he would be killed by one. Riddick is a Furian. Back on Crematoria,Riddick and his fellow escapees race across the ravaged surface to stay ahead of the sunrise,as the surface termperature of the planet increases to 700F in full daylight,and fight the surviving prison guards on the way. They reach the escape ship only to find Necros and guards already there. A three-way battle ensues between the Necros,the convicts,and the guards; the guards are all killed,Kyra taken prisoner,and Riddick left for dead by Necro Commander Vaako. He is rescued from the sunlight by a Necro who was born a Furian like Riddick,who gives him a message from the Lord Marshal (in case he survived the attack): he will no longer be hunted so long as he stays away from Helion. The ex-Furian gives Riddick a Furian knife,then kills himself. Naturally,Riddick heads to Helion to take on the Lord Marshal and find Kyra. Believing Riddick dead,the Lord Marshal promotes Vaako to first among Commanders. The scheming Dame Vaako realizes Riddick is on Helion,and plots with Vaako to let Riddick attack the Lord Marshal and,if he is at all successful,finish him off and sieze power themselves. Aerion reveals to the Lord Marshal that Riddick is in all probability still alive. Riddick attacks the Lord Marshal. The Lord Marshal tells Riddick to join him,and reveals that Kyra has been turned to a Necro. Riddick fights him instead,and is nearly killed before Kyra - apparently not all Necro yet - spears the Lord Marshal in the back. The Lord Marshal returns the favour and impales her on a spike jutting from the wall. Seeing the opportunity,Vaako grabs an axe and swoops in to finish off the Lord Marshal,but Riddick kills him first with the Furian knife. Kyra,dying,tells Riddick she was always with him. Riddick collapses on the Necro throne,and they all bow to him,their new leader.</Plot>

        <Plot>After a series of strange events around the world connected by variances in the Earth&apos;s electromagnetic field,scientists,led by Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci),discover that the Earth&apos;s rotating molten core is slowly coming to a stop; without its movement,the electromagnetic field around the earth will disappear,exposing the surface to the unfiltered solar radiation and will incinerate anything or anyone exposed to it. Keyes and Zimsky are charged to find a way to restart the core,which requires traveling deep into the Earth and setting off nuclear charges to induce rotational force.Keyes and Zimsky seek the help of Dr. Serge Leveque (TchÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©ky Karyo),a weapons expert,and Ed &quot;Braz&quot; Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo). Brazzelton reveals a means of not only drilling through the Earth at high speeds using a series of lasers,but also has devised a material &quot;unobtainium&quot; which is capable of withstanding the pressures deep inside the planet as well as generating energy from them. Keyes himself works to create a means to visualize their path through rock structures via x-rays. To avoid creating a worldwide panic,an expert hacker,Theodore &quot;Rat&quot; Donald Finch (DJ Qualls),is found by an FBI agent (John Shaw) and is brought to monitor the Internet and erase any rumors to the potential fate of the planet. However,there is a hint that the Army is hiding the real reason of the incoming catastrophe.The team constructs a snake-like ship named Virgil made up of several compartments that will be launched over the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean,the deepest such area on Earth. Keyes,Zimsky,Leveque,and Brazzelton are joined by NASA astronauts Commander Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and Major Rebecca &quot;Beck&quot; Childs (Hilary Swank),who will pilot the ship. She has just about been court martialled,although deemed innocent by the army judge (Fred Keating) of reckless flying.The launch goes successfully and the team finds their equipment is working to expectations as they begin their descent. After successful descent on the 700 miles depth,they run into a snag when they breach a gigantic geode-like structure,damaging the laser drilling device. Iverson and Zimsky find out that they are in fact inside a cobalt cocoon full of amethyst. During the repairs,Iverson is killed by falling crystal shards so Beck will now have to pilot the ship to the Earth&apos;s core. They repair the ship and escape just before the geode crushes and lava pours in.As they dive further,a large diamond breaches the hull of the last compartment where Leveque is preparing the nuclear devices for activation; he sacrifices himself to make sure that Keyes has the launch codes as the compartment,no longer able to withstand the pressure,is crushed. When they finally breach the molten core,they perform a series of calculations and find that their original plan would fail to restart the core due to unexpected physical property differences. The team calculates that they can still restart the core by decoupling each compartment of Virgil at precise positions,timing the nuclear devices in each to go off to obtain the best force they can impart to the core. However,in order to separate the individual compartments,one member will have to enter the open area at the front of Virgil,which is exposed directly to the heat of the molten core and likely will not survive. Brazzelton offers to do so and sacrifices himself to the cause.Meanwhile,on the surface,the public become aware of problems after a lightning superstorm appears over Rome and destroys the Colosseum and a patch of unfiltered sunlight over San Francisco melts the Golden Gate Bridge. Rat is unable to stop the release of the news,but learns of a device called &quot;D.E.S.T.I.N.I.&quot; (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger Initiative),the news of which he relays to Keyes. Keyes learns that the DESTINI project was an attempt to propagate earthquakes through Earth&apos;s core as a weapon,but instead was the cause for stopping its rotation,and that Zimsky was a critical figure behind its design. Zimsky reveals that the government will attempt to use the device again to try to restart the core,which could have disastrous results.Keyes gets Rat to disable the power to the device while they attempt to plot the proper locations for the detonations,long enough for the Virgil team to detach each compartment,planting the nuclear devices at key points in the molten core. While Keyes and Zimsky activate the bombs,they realise that the blast won&apos;t be effective enough so they decide to restart the timers. While they do so,Zimsky is trapped in one of the compartments and must be left behind by Keyes and Childs. Before the compartment with Zimsky is disconnected,he reveals to Keyes that the explosion can be effective only if he uses the Virgil&apos;s fuel rod to increase the blast power of the last bomb. While the timer for the nuclear explosions ticks down,the two find they are within the blast radius of the devices,and are forced to rig the ship,using the power generated by the unobtainium,to move themselves out of the way in time.As they speed out of the core,the series of nuclear explosions goes off successfully restarting the core&apos;s rotation. Keyes and Childs are able to safely make it to the ocean floor in Virgil but without heat,they are unable to get to the surface. However,their position is found by the military by tracking whalesong singing over their ship. Shortly after they are recovered,Rat,through Keyes&apos; directive,releases full information of Project DESTINI and of their mission to the Internet,which reveals the truth to all,and ensures that Iverson,Serge,Braz,and Zimsky are not forgotten,but rather lauded as heroes.</Plot>

        <Plot>Five Michigan State University students venture into the hills to spend a weekend in an isolated cabin. There they find the Book of the Dead (a Babylonian and Sumerian text,unrelated to the Egyptian Book of the Dead),otherwise known as the Morturom Demonto.While searching the basement of the cabin,the students find and play a tape recording of demonic incantations from the book,unwittingly resurrecting slumbering demons that thirst for revenge. The characters are then possessed one by one,beginning with Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) after she is brutally raped by the evil force (using the nearby trees) in sequences of intense,bloody violence and horrifying voice-overs. Cheryl makes it home to the cabin but nobody believes her. Her brother Ash (Bruce Campbell) then decides to drive her into town where she can stay the night. They discover that the only road bridge is completely destroyed and the supports are bent into the shape of a hand. Soon after,Cheryl becomes a demon and stabs Linda (Betsy Baker) in the ankle with a pencil. They lock her in the cellar,but soon after Shelly (Theresa Tilly) becomes possessed and attacks Scotty (Richard DeManincor) who dismembers her with an axe. They wrap the dismembered body-parts in a blanket and bury them,after which Scotty leaves to find a trail out of the woods.Ash goes to check on Linda,but finds her to be possessed also. Scotty returns,but is mutilated by trees. Before losing consciousness he tells Ash there is a trail in the woods. After Linda tricks Ash by returning to (seemingly) normal,Ash drags her outside. He goes back to check on Scotty,who dies. Linda later returns and tries to stab Ash,but she falls on the dagger. Ash drags her outside to cut her up with a chainsaw,but he simply buries her instead. She rises from the grave and Ash beheads her with a shovel. The head soon comes back to life and taunts him,and the body gets up to chase Ash back to the cabin. He returns to find the cellar door flown open. Cheryl jumps at the window and tries to break in. Ash shoots her,but she doesn&apos;t die. Ash then proceeds to barricade both the front and back doors. He runs back into the cellar to find a box of shotgun shells and experiences a strange series of events including the cellar filling with blood and hearing things in his mind. Cheryl tries to attack Ash through the door,but he shoots her and then slides a bookshelf in front of the door. Scotty&apos;s dead body suddenly animates and he and Cheryl come at Ash again. Suddenly they begin to scream,and smoke starts to rise from their bodies. Ash notices that The Book of the Dead has fallen into the fireplace. He puts it directly into the flames and the demons stop and begin to rot away as dawn breaks. Ash is the only survivor. He heads outside and stands there for a while,thinking he has survived the ordeal; but the evil &quot;force&quot; runs him down. The screen goes black as Ash turns around with a look of terror on his face as the Evil catches him.</Plot>

        <Plot>In late summer 1945,guests are gathered for the wedding reception of Don Vito Corleone&apos;s daughter Connie (Talia Shire) and Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo). Vito (Marlon Brando),the head of the Corleone Mafia family,is known to friends and associates as &quot;Godfather.&quot; He and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall),the Corleone family lawyer,are hearing requests for favors because,according to tradition,&quot;no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter&apos;s wedding day.&quot; One of the men who asks the Don for a favor is Amerigo Bonasera,a successful mortician and old friend of the Don,whose daughter was beaten by two young men who received minimal punishment. The Don is mostly disappointed in Bonasera,who&apos;d avoided most contact with the Don due to Corleone&apos;s nefarious business dealings. The Don&apos;s wife is also godmother to Bonasera&apos;s shamed daughter,a relation the Don uses to extract new loyalty from the undertaker. The Don agrees to have his men punish the young men responsible.Meanwhile,the Don&apos;s youngest son Michael (Al Pacino),a decorated Marine hero returning from World War II service,arrives at the wedding and tells his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) anecdotes about his family,informing her about his father&apos;s criminal life; he reassures her that he is different from his family and doesn&apos;t plan to join them in their criminal dealings. As it depicts the marriage of Connie and Carlo,the wedding scene also serves as critical exposition for the remainder of the film,as Michael figuratively introduces the main characters to Kay. Fredo,Michael&apos;s next older brother,is mostly dimwitted and quite drunk by the time he finds Michael at the party. Sonny,the Don&apos;s oldest child and eldest son,is married but a philanderer who sneaks into a bedroom with one of Connie&apos;s bridesmaids,Lucy Mancini. Tom Hagen is not related to the family by blood but is considered one of the Don&apos;s sons because he was homeless when he&apos;d befriended Sonny in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan. Now a talented attorney,Tom is being groomed for the important position of consigliere (counselor) to the Don,despite his non-Sicilian heritage.Also among the guests at the celebration is the famous singer Johnny Fontane (Al Martino),Corleone&apos;s godson,who has come from Hollywood to petition Vito&apos;s help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Jack Woltz (John Marley),the head of the studio,denies Fontane the part which is a character much like Johnny himself,and which will make him an even bigger star,but Don Corleone explains to Johnny: &quot;I&apos;m gonna make him an offer he can&apos;t refuse.&quot;After the wedding,Hagen is dispatched to California to meet with Woltz,but Woltz angrily tells him that he will never cast Fontane in the role. Fontane had previously seduced and &quot;ruined&quot; a starlet that Woltz favored and had a sexual relationship with. Woltz is persuaded otherwise,however,when he wakes up early the next morning and feels something wet in his bed. He pulls back the sheets,and finds himself in a pool of blood with the severed head of his prized $600,000 stud horse,Khartoum,in the bed with him,and screams in horror. (A deleted scene from the film implies that Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana),Vito&apos;s top &quot;button man&quot; or hitman,is responsible.)Upon Hagen&apos;s return,the family meets with Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo (Al Lettieri),who is being backed by the rival Tattaglia family. He asks Don Corleone for financing and political and legal protection for importing and distributing heroin. Despite the huge profit to be made,Corleone refuses,explaining that his political influence would be jeopardized by a move into the narcotics trade. The Don&apos;s eldest son,hotheaded Sonny (James Caan),who had earlier urged the family to enter the narcotics trade,breaks ranks during the meeting and questions Sollozzo&apos;s assurances as to the Corleone Family&apos;s investment being guaranteed by the Tattaglia Family. His father,angry at Sonny&apos;s dissension in a non-family member&apos;s presence,privately rebukes him later. Don Corleone then dispatches Luca Brasi to infiltrate Sollozzo&apos;s organization and report back with information. During the meeting,while Brasi is bent over to allow Bruno Tattaglia to light his cigarette,he is stabbed in the hand by Sollozzo,and is subsequently garroted by an assassin.Soon after his meeting with Sollozzo,Don Corleone is gunned down in an assassination attempt just outside his office,and it is not immediately known whether he has survived. Fredo Corleone had been assigned driving and protection duty for his father when Paulie Gatto,the Don&apos;s usual bodyguard,had called in sick. Fredo proves to be ineffectual,fumbling with his gun and unable to shoot back. When Sonny hears about the Don being shot and Paulie&apos;s absence,he orders Clemenza to find Paulie and bring him to the Don&apos;s house.Sollozzo abducts Tom Hagen and persuades him to offer Sonny the deal previously offered to his father. Enraged,Sonny refuses to consider it and issues an ultimatum to the Tattaglias turn over Sollozzo or face a lengthy,bloody and costly (for both sides) gang war. They refuse,and instead send Sonny &quot;a Sicilian message,&quot; in the form of two fresh fish wrapped in Luca Brasi&apos;s bullet-proof vest,to tell the Corleones that Luca Brasi &quot;sleeps with the fishes.&quot;Clemenza later takes Paulie and one of the family&apos;s hitmen,Rocco Lampone,for a drive into Manhattan on orders from Sonny who wants to &quot;go to the mattresses&quot;,setting up beds in apartments for Corleone button men to operate out of in the event that the crime war breaks out. On their way back from Manhattan,Clemenza has Paulie stop the car in a remote area so he can urinate. Rocco shoots Paulie dead; he and Clemenza leave Paulie and the car behind.Michael,whom the other Mafia families consider a &quot;civilian&quot; uninvolved in mob business,visits his father at a small private hospital. He is shocked to find that no one is guarding him. Realizing that his father is again being set up to be killed,he calls Sonny for help,moves his father to another room,and goes outside to watch the entrance. Michael enlists help from Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei),who has come to the hospital to pay his respects. Together,they bluff away Sollozzo&apos;s men as they drive by. Police cars soon appear bringing the corrupt Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden),who breaks Michael&apos;s jaw when Michael insinuates that Sollozzo paid McCluskey to set up his father. Just then,Hagen arrives with &quot;private detectives&quot; licensed to carry guns to protect Don Corleone,and he takes Michael home. Sonny responds by having Bruno Tattaglia (Tony Giorgio),son and underboss of Don Phillip Tattaglia (Victor Rendina),killed.Following the attempt on the Don&apos;s life at the hospital,Sollozzo requests a meeting with the Corleones,which Captain McCluskey will attend as Sollozzo&apos;s bodyguard. When Michael volunteers to kill both men during the meeting,Sonny and the other senior Family members are amused; however,Michael convinces them that he is serious and that killing Sollozzo and McCluskey is in the family&apos;s interest: &quot;It&apos;s not personal. It&apos;s strictly business.&quot; Although police officers are usually off limits for hits,Michael argues that since McCluskey is corrupt and has illegal dealings with Sollozzo,he is fair game.Before the meeting in an Italian restaurant,McCluskey frisks Michael for weapons and finds him clean. Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom where he retrieves a planted revolver,and returning to the table,he fatally shoots Sollozzo,then McCluskey. Michael is sent to hide in Sicily,while the Corleone family prepares for all-out warfare with the Five Families who are united against the Corleones,as well as a general clampdown on the mob by the police and government authorities.Sonny severely beats Carlo Rizzi for brutalizing the pregnant Connie,and threatens to kill him if he ever abuses his sister again. An angry Carlo responds by plotting with Tattaglia and Don Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte),the Corleones&apos; chief rivals,to have Sonny killed. Carlo again beats Connie in order to lure Sonny out. Furious,Sonny drives off alone to fulfill his threat. On the way,he is ambushed at a toll booth and shot to death by several men wielding Thompson submachine guns.Back in New York City,Don Corleone returns home from the hospital and is distraught to learn that it was Michael who killed Sollozzo and McCluskey and that Sonny is dead. Rather than seek revenge for Sonny&apos;s killing,Don Corleone meets with the heads of the Five Families to negotiate a cease-fire. Not only is it draining all their assets and threatening their survival,but ending the conflict is the only way that Michael can return home safely. Reversing his previous decision,Vito agrees that the Corleone family will provide political protection for Tattaglia&apos;s traffic in heroin,as long as it is controlled and not sold to children. At the meeting,Don Corleone deduces that Don Barzini,not Tattaglia,was ultimately behind the mob war and Sonny&apos;s death.In Sicily,Michael patiently waits out his exile,protected by Don Tommasino (Corrado Gaipa),an old family friend. Michael aimlessly wanders the countryside,accompanied by his ever-present bodyguards,Calo (Franco Citti) and Fabrizio (Angelo Infanti). In a small village,Michael meets and falls in love with Apollonia Vitelli (Simonetta Stefanelli),the beautiful young daughter of a bar owner. They court and marry in the traditional Sicilian fashion,but soon Michael&apos;s presence becomes known to Corleone enemies. As the couple is about to be moved to a safer location,Apollonia is killed when their car is bombed; Michael,who barely escapes alive,spots Fabrizio hurriedly leaving the grounds seconds before the explosion,implicating him in the assassination plot. In a deleted scene,Fabrizio is found years later and killed.With his safety guaranteed,Michael returns home. More than a year later,he reunites with his former girlfriend Kay after a total of four years of separation,three in Italy,and one in America. He tells her he wants them to be married. Although Kay is hurt that he waited so long to contact her,she accepts his proposal. With the Don semi-retired,Sonny dead,and middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) considered incapable of running the family business,Michael is now in charge; he promises Kay he will make the family business completely legitimate within five years.Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda),two Corleone Family caporegimes (captains),complain that they are being pushed around by the Barzini Family and ask permission to strike back,but Michael denies the request. He plans to move the family operations to Nevada and after that,Clemenza and Tessio may break away to form their own families. Michael further promises Connie&apos;s husband,Carlo,that he will be his right hand man in Nevada. Tom Hagen has been removed as consigliere and is now merely the family&apos;s lawyer,with Vito serving as consigliere. Privately,Hagen complains about his change in status,and also questions Michael about a new regime of &quot;soldiers&quot; secretly being built under Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui). Don Vito explains to Hagen that Michael is acting on his advice.In Las Vegas Michael meets with Moe Greene (Alex Rocco),a rich and shrewd casino boss looking to expand his business dealings. After the Don&apos;s assassination,Fredo had been sent to Las Vegas to learn about the casino business from Greene. Michael offers to buy out Greene but is rudely rebuffed. Greene believes the Corleones are weak and that he can secure a better deal from Barzini. As Moe and Michael heatedly negotiate,Fredo sides with Moe. Afterward,Michael warns Fredo to never again &quot;take sides with anyone against the family.&quot;Michael returns home. In a private moment,Vito explains his expectation that the Family&apos;s enemies will attempt to murder Michael by using a trusted associate to arrange a meeting as a pretext for assassination. Vito also reveals that he had never really intended a life of crime for Michael,hoping that his youngest son would hold legitimate power as a senator or governor. Shortly after,Vito collapses and dies while playing with his young grandson Anthony (Anthony Gounaris) in his tomato garden. At the burial,Tessio conveys a proposal for a meeting with Barzini,which identifies Tessio as the traitor that Vito was expecting.Michael arranges for a series of murders to occur simultaneously while he is standing godfather to Connie&apos;s and Carlo&apos;s newborn son at the church.Don Stracci (Don Costello) is gunned down along with his men in an elevator by Clemenza. Moe Greene is killed while having a massage,shot through the eye by an unidentified assassin. Don Cuneo (Rudy Bond) is trapped in a revolving door and shot dead by Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell). Don Tattaglia is assassinated in his bed,along with a prostitute,by Rocco Lampone and an unknown associate. Don Barzini is killed on the steps of his office building along with his bodyguard and driver,shot by Al Neri (Richard Bright),disguised in his old police uniform.After the baptism,Tessio believes he and Hagen are on their way to the meeting between Michael and Barzini that he has arranged. Instead,he is surrounded by Willi Cicci and other button men as Hagen steps away. Realizing that Michael has uncovered his betrayal,Tessio tells Hagen that he always respected Michael,and that his disloyalty &quot;was only business.&quot; He asks if Tom can get him off for &quot;old times&apos; sake,&quot; but Tom says he cannot. Meanwhile,Michael confronts Carlo about Sonny&apos;s murder and forces him to admit his role in setting up the ambush,having been approached by Barzini himself. Michael assures Carlo he will not be killed,but his punishment is exclusion from all family business. He hands Carlo a plane ticket to exile in Las Vegas. However,when Carlo gets into a car headed for the airport,he is garroted to death by Clemenza,on Michael&apos;s orders.Later,a hysterical Connie confronts Michael,accusing him of murdering Carlo. Kay questions Michael about Connie&apos;s accusation,but he refuses to answer,reminding her to never ask him about his business. She insists,and Michael lies,reassuring his wife that he played no role in Carlo&apos;s death. Kay believes him and is relieved. The film ends with Clemenza and new caporegimes Rocco Lampone and Al Neri paying their respects to Michael. Clemenza kisses Michael&apos;s hand and greets him as &quot;Don Corleone.&quot; As Kay watches,the door is closed. Michael is the new Godfather.</Plot>

        <Plot>The Godfather Part II presents two parallel storylines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father,Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925,from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York.The film begins in 1901,in the town of Corleone in Sicily,at the funeral of young Vito&apos;s father,Antonio Andolini,who has been murdered for an insult to the local Mafia lord,Don Ciccio. During the procession,Vito&apos;s older brother is murdered because he swore revenge on the Don. Vito&apos;s mother goes to Ciccio to beg for mercy,but he refuses,knowing that nine year old Vito will seek revenge later in life. The mother takes Ciccio hostage at knifepoint,allowing her son to escape,and Ciccio&apos;s men kill her. They search the town for the boy,but he is aided in his escape by the townspeople. Vito finds his way by ship to New York,and at Ellis Island an immigration agent chooses Vito&apos;s hometown of Corleone as his surname,and he is registered as &quot;Vito Corleone&quot;.In the late 1950s,in a scene similar to the opening of the first film,Michael Corleone,Godfather of the Corleone family,deals with various business and family problems during an elaborate party at his Lake Tahoe,Nevada compound to celebrate his son&apos;s First Communion. He meets with Nevada Senator Pat Geary,who despises the Corleones,to discuss the price of the gaming licenses for the hotel/casinos the Family is buying.Michael deals with his sister Connie,who,although recently divorced,is planning to marry a man with no obvious means of support and of whom Michael disapproves. He also talks with Johnny Ola,the right hand man of Jewish gangster Hyman Roth,who is supporting Michael&apos;s move into the gambling industry. Belatedly,Michael deals with Frank &quot;Five Angels&quot; Pentangeli,who took over Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza&apos;s territory after his death,and now has problems with the Rosato Brothers,who are backed by Roth. Pentangeli leaves abruptly,after telling Michael &quot;your father did business with Hyman Roth,your father respected Hyman Roth,but your father never trusted Hyman Roth.&quot;Later that night,Michael barely escapes an assassination attempt when his wife Kay notices the bedroom window drapes are inexplicably open. Afterwards,Michael tells Tom Hagen that the hit was made with the help of someone close,and that he must leave,entrusting all his power to Hagen to protect his family.The action then switches to 1917,where the adult Vito Corleone works in a New York grocery store with his friend Genco Abbandando. The neighborhood is controlled by a member of the &quot;The Black Hand,&quot; Don Fanucci,who extorts protection payments from local businesses. One night,Vito&apos;s neighbor Clemenza asks him to hide a stash of guns for him,and later,to repay the favor,takes him to a fancy apartment where they commit their first felony together,stealing an elegant rug.The film flash-forwards to Michael&apos;s time. Michael meets with poushal Hyman Roth in Florida and tells him that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt,and that Pentangeli will pay for it. Traveling to Brooklyn,Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it,and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth,but he needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato Brothers in order to put Roth off guard. When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos,he is told &quot;Michael Corleone says hello,&quot; as he is attacked from behind but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman. Pentangeli is left for dead,and his bodyguard,Willie Cicci,is struck by a car.In Nevada,Tom Hagen is called to a brothel run by Michael&apos;s older brother Fredo,where Senator Geary is implicated in the death of a prostitute,and Tom offers to take care of the problem in return for &quot;friendship&quot; between the Senator and the Corleone family.Meanwhile,Michael meets Roth in Havana,Cuba,in late 1958,at the time when dictator Fulgencio Batista is soliciting American investment,and communist guerrillas are trying to bring down the government. At a birthday party for Roth,Michael mentions that there is a possibility that the rebels might win,making their business dealings in Cuba problematic. Earlier that day Michael had witnessed a communist rebel killing Havana policemen by detonating a grenade that also kills the rebel himself. The comment prompts Roth to remark,privately,that Michael has not delivered the two million dollars to firm their partnership.Fredo,carrying the promised money,arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael mentions Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola to him,but Fredo says he has never met them. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him,and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move,and that &quot;Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.&quot;Instead of turning over the money to Roth,Michael asks him who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. Roth avoids the question,instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend,Moe Greene,which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the first film).Michael has asked Fredo,who knows Havana well,to show Senator Geary and other important officials and businessmen a good time,during which Fredo pretends to not recognize Johnny Ola. Soon after,at a sex show,Fredo comments loudly that Johnny Ola told him about the place,contradicting what he told Michael twice earlier,that he didn&apos;t know Roth or Ola. Michael now realizes that the traitor is his own brother,and dispatches his bodyguard to deal with Roth.Johnny Ola is strangled,but Roth,in a delicate state,is taken to a hospital,where Michael&apos;s enforcer is shot trying to kill him. At Batista&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve party,at the stroke of midnight,Michael grasps Fredo tightly by the head and kisses him: &quot;I know it was you Fredo; you broke my heart.&quot; When guerrillas attack,the guests flee,but Fredo refuses to go with Michael,despite Michael&apos;s pleas that Fredo is still his brother and that it&apos;s the only way out.Michael returns to his Lake Tahoe compound,where Hagen tells him that Roth escaped Cuba after suffering a stroke and is recovering in Miami,that Michael&apos;s bodyguard is dead,and that Fredo is probably hiding in New York. Hagen also informs Michael that Kay had a miscarriage while he was away. Michael is distraught at the news and furiously demands to know the sex of the child,but Tom is unable to tell him.In New York of 1917,Don Fanucci of the Black Hand is now aware of the partnership between Vito,Clemenza and Sal Tessio,and wants his share. Clemenza and Tessio agree to pay,but Vito is reluctant and asks his friends to leave everything in his hands so Fanucci will accept less and indeed,Vito manages to get Fanucci to take only one sixth of what he demanded (100 of 600 dollars). Immediately afterwards,during the neighborhood festa,Vito murders Fanucci. With Fanucci dead,Vito earns the respect of the neighborhood and begins to intercede in local disputes,operating out of the storefront of his Genco Pura Olive Oil Company (named after his friend Genco Abbandando).In Washington,D.C.,a Senate committee,of which Senator Geary is a member,is conducting an investigation into the Corleone family. They question disaffected &quot;soldier&quot; Willie Cicci,but he cannot implicate Michael,because he never received any direct orders from him. When Michael appears before the committee,Senator Geary makes a big show of supporting Italian-Americans and then excuses himself from the proceedings. Michael makes a statement challenging the committee to produce a witness to corroborate the charges against him. The hearing ends with the Chairman promising a witness who will do exactly that.Frank Pentangeli,who did not die in the attack by the Rosato Brothers,has made a deal with the FBI,and will testify against Michael. Tom Hagen and Michael discuss the problem,observing that Roth&apos;s strategy to destroy Michael is well planned. Michael&apos;s brother Fredo has been found and persuaded to return to Nevada,and in a private meeting he explains to Michael his betrayal: upset about being passed over to head the family in favor of Michael,he wants respect and his due. He helped Roth thinking there would be something in it for him,but he swears he didn&apos;t know they wanted to kill Michael. He also tells Michael that the Senate Committee&apos;s chief counsel is Roth&apos;s man. Michael then tells Fredo: &quot;You&apos;re nothing to me now. Not a brother,not a friend,nothing&quot;,and privately instructs Al Neri that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is still alive.At the hearing in which Pentangeli is to testify,Michael arrives accompanied by Pentangeli&apos;s brother,brought from Sicily,and whose presence causes Frank to recant his previous statements about Michael. When Pentangeli is pressed,he claims that he just told the FBI what they wanted to hear. With no witness to testify against Michael the committee adjourns,with Hagen,acting as Michael&apos;s lawyer,loudly demanding an apology.At a hotel room afterwards,Kay tries to leave Michael,taking their children with her. Michael at first tries to mollify her,but loses his temper and hits her violently when she reveals to him that her recent &quot;miscarriage&quot; was actually an abortion to avoid providing another child into Michael&apos;s criminal inheritance. She also tells him that the baby was a boy,further infuriating Michael.While visiting Sicily,Vito is introduced to the elderly Don Ciccio as the man who imports their olive oil to America,and who wants his blessing. When Ciccio asks Vito who his father was,Vito says,&quot;My father&apos;s name is Antonio Andolini,and this is for you!&quot;,cutting the old man&apos;s stomach open with a knife,avenging the death of his father,mother,and brother. As they make their escape from Ciccio&apos;s compound and his men,Don Tomasello is shot in the leg - the injury gives him a permanent limp.When Carmella Corleone,Vito&apos;s widow and the mother of his children,dies,the whole Corleone family is reunited. Michael still shuns Fredo,who is miserable,but relents when Connie implores him to. Michael and Fredo embrace,but at the same time Michael signals to his capo that Fredo&apos;s protection from harm,in effect while their mother lived,has now run out.Michael,Tom Hagen,and Rocco Lampone discuss their final dealings with Hyman Roth,who has been unsuccessfully seeking asylum from various countries,and was even refused entry to Israel as a returned Jew. Michael rejects Hagen&apos;s advice that the Corleone family&apos;s position is secure,and killing Roth and the Rosato brothers for revenge is an unnecessary risk. Later,Hagen pays a visit to Frank Pentangeli on a military base and suggests that he take his own life,in the manner of unsuccessful ancient Roman conspirators who,in return,were promised that their families would be taken care of after their suicide.With the connivance of Connie,Kay visits her children,but cannot bear to leave them and stays too long. When Michael arrives,he coldly closes the door in her face.The Godfather Part II reaches its climax in a montage of assassinations and death,reminiscent of the end of The Godfather. As he arrives at an airport to be taken into custody,Hyman Roth is killed by Rocco Lampone disguised as a journalist,who himself is immediately shot dead. On the military base,Frank Pentangeli is found dead,having followed Hagen&apos;s instructions and committed suicide in his bathtub. Finally,Fredo is murdered by Al Neri while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe - while Fredo is saying a Hail Mary to help catch a fish.The penultimate scene takes place in 1941,and the Corleone family is preparing a surprise birthday party for Vito. Sonny introduces Carlo Rizzi,Connie&apos;s future husband and betrayer of Sonny,to his family. They all talk about the recent attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese,and Michael shocks everybody by announcing that he has just enlisted in the United States Marines. Sonny ridicules Michael&apos;s choice,and Tom Hagen mentions how his father has great expectations for Michael. Fredo is the only one who supports his brother&apos;s decision. Sal Tessio comes in with the cake for the party,and when Vito arrives,all but Michael leave to greet him.The final scene in the film is Michael sitting by himself at Lake Tahoe,in silent contemplation.</Plot>

        <Plot>The movie begins in 1979,with a brief flashback establishing the long and tragic history of criminal activity within,and by,the Corleone family. Much has changed. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now approaching 60 and feels tremendous guilt for indulging in his ruthless ambition many years ago. Although his previous conquests have made him a very rich man,the thoughts of his children,their future,happiness,and his legacy are the only things keeping him going. His adopted brother Tom Hagen is now dead. The Corleone compound at Lake Tahoe is abandoned and in disrepair. Michael and Kay (Diane Keaton) divorced in 1959,and Michael gave her custody of their children,Anthony (Franc D&apos;Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola).Michael has returned to New York City,where he is using his enormous wealth and power to restore his dignity and reputation in the eyes of the public. The violent criminal element of the Corleone family has been largely abandoned,ostracized by Michael as well as the public,which no longer romanticizes the gangster lifestyle. Michael has embraced corporate America,which is now more tolerant of Michael&apos;s nihilism. He has rebuilt the Corleone interests as a legitimate enterprise using the blood money from his gangster years. The thugs and sociopathic soldiers from Michael&apos;s past have either gone into the underground,or have been relegated to the background,serving as bodyguards for Michael and his family. Michael now struggles between repairing his fragile relationships while trying to contain the violent sociopaths that are still a part of his decaying criminal empire. In an attempt to break with the past,Michael creates a charity,the Vito Corleone Foundation,in memory of his father. At a ceremony in St. Patricks Cathedral,presided over by Archbishop Gilday,Michael is named a Commander of the Order of St. Sebastian. Kay,who has remarried,sits with Michael&apos;s children at the ceremony.At the lavish party following the ceremony,Kay and Michael have a somewhat uneasy reunion. Anthony tells his father that he is going to drop out of law school to pursue a career as an opera singer. Kay supports his choice,but Michael disagrees,wishing that his son would finish law school or join the family business. Michael eventually acquiesces to Anthony&apos;s wishes. Meanwhile,Vincent Mancini,Sonny Corleone&apos;s illegitimate son,shows up at the party. He is embroiled in a feud with Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna),the Corleone family&apos;s mafioso muscle. What remains of the old Corleone criminal empire is now under Zasa&apos;s stewardship. However,the Corleone&apos;s old neighborhood in New York City is in ruins,and has become lawless. In Michael&apos;s study,Vincent and Zasa tell him about their feud. The discussion grows violent,with Vincent accusing Zasa of being an out-of-control monster who mocks Michael behind his back. Michael makes it clear that he is not &quot;a gangster&quot; and that whatever bad blood exists between Vincent and Joey Zasa is none of his business,and must be settled between only them. He asks the two men to make peace with one another. The two men embrace,but Zasa insults Vincent by whispering &quot;bastardo&quot; in his ear. Enraged,Vincent bites off part of Zasas ear. Zasa is escorted out and Michael scolds Vincent for his violent ways. But impressed by Vincent&apos;s passionate loyalty to protect him,Michael agrees to take his nephew under his wing. The party concludes with a family picture where Michael asks Vincent to join the rest of the family.That night,two men break into Vincent&apos;s home,after Vincent has spent the night with a female journalist (Bridget Fonda). Vincent brutally kills one in order to frighten the other into revealing Zasa as the man who sent them. Vincent then ruthlessly kills the second man.Later,in an attempt to garner respectability and wealth for the Corleone Family through legitimate enterprise,Michael seeks to buy the Vatican&apos;s shares in Immobiliare,an international real estate holding company,of which 25% is controlled by the Vatican. He negotiates the transfer of $600,000,000 to the Vatican Bank with Archbishop Gilday,who has plunged the Holy See into tremendous debt through his poor management and corrupt dealings. While in Vatican City,Michael learns that several influential parties oppose the deal for many reasons,not the least of which is the extensive criminal history that has tarnished the Corleone name. Because of this and the failing health of Pope Paul VI,ratification of the deal will be far more complicated than he had anticipated.Don Altobello (Eli Wallach),an elderly New York mafia chief,tells Michael that his old New York partners want in on the Immobiliare deal. A meeting is arranged in Atlantic City,and Michael appeases most of the mafiosi with generous payoffs from their casino days. Zasa,however,gets nothing. Furious,he declares that Michael is his enemy,and tells everyone in the room they must choose between him and Michael. Zasa storms out of the meeting. Don Altobello runs after him to try and talk to him about this irrational move. Minutes later,a helicopter hovers above the conference room and sprays a barrage of bullets through the ceiling windows. Almost everyone is killed,but Michael,Vincent,and Michael&apos;s bodyguard and caporegime,Al Neri,manage to escape. Back at his apartment in New York,as Michael considers how to respond to this hit,he suffers a diabetic stroke,and is hospitalized. During the diabetic attack,in a near-delirium,Michael screams out the name of his brother,Fredo,whose murder he had ordered some 20 years earlier.Though they are cousins,Vincent and Mary begin a romantic relationship. Unbeknownst to Michael,Vincent,with the urging of his aunt Connie,plots revenge against Joey Zasa. During a street fair similar to that seen in The Godfather Part II,Vincent and his accomplices kill Zasa&apos;s bodyguards,and Vincent,disguised as a mounted New York police officer,shortly murders Zasa himself. Michael,still hospitalized,berates Vincent when he finds out,but Vincent insists that he got the go-ahead from Al Neri and from Connie,who has become deeply involved in family affairs. Michael insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary because Vincent&apos;s involvement in the family puts Mary&apos;s life in jeopardy. Vincent agrees.The family travels to Sicily. Michael tells Vincent to speak with Don Altobello and,in order to see where the old man&apos;s loyalties lie,to intimate to him his intentions of leaving the Corleone family,under the pretense that his affair with Mary still exists,and that his loyalty to Michael has been supplanted by his desire to continue the relationship. Altobello supports the idea of Vincent switching his allegiance,and introduces him to Licio Lucchesi,the man behind the plot to prevent Michael&apos;s acquisition of Immobiliare.Michael also has lunch with Kay,and asks forgiveness for his behavior 20 years earlier. He also tells her that he never planned to go into a life of crime. Kay admits that she still loves Michael,and the two make plans to begin a new life together.Michael visits Cardinal Lamberto,a well-intentioned and pious priest,to speak about the Immobiliare deal. Lamberto convinces Michael to make his first confession in thirty years; among other sins,Michael confesses to ordering the killing of his brother Fredo. After confessing Michael breaks down in tears. He is told by Lamberto that it is &quot;just that he should suffer,&quot; and that although he could tell Michael to repent,he knows Michael would not. Nevertheless,he absolves Michael of his sins. Touring Sicily with Kay,who has arrived for Anthony&apos;s operatic debut,Michael also asks for her forgiveness. As both admit that they still love each other,Michael receives word that Don Tommasino,his Sicilian friend and ally of the Corleone Family for half a century,has been killed (by a famous assassin),signaling that a new round of violence is about to begin. Cardinal Lamberto is elected Pope John Paul I,which means that the Immobiliare deal will likely be ratified,due to his intention to &quot;clean up&quot; the dealings of the Vatican. The new Pope&apos;s intentions come as a death knell to the plot against the ratification of the Immobiliare deal,prompting frantic attempts by the plotters to cover their own tracks.Vincent tells Michael what he has learned from Altobello: Lucchesi is behind the plot against the Immobiliare deal,and a master assassin known as Mosca da Montelepre (the man who killed Tommasino),has been hired by Altobello to kill Michael. Vincent wants to strike back,but Michael cautions him,saying that if he goes ahead with such a plan,there&apos;ll be no going back. Vincent insists on revenge,and Michael relents. He makes Vincent head of the Corleone family,the new Godfather. In exchange for the promotion,Vincent agrees to put an end to his heated relationship with Mary once and for all.The family travels to Palermo to see Anthony perform the lead in Cavalleria Rusticana at the renowned opera house Teatro Massimo. Meanwhile,Vincent makes plans to seek revenge against the Corleone family&apos;s enemies.Interspersed with scenes from Anthony&apos;s performance are the brutal murders of the enemies of the Corleone family. Michael Corleone&apos;s theme,Halls of Fear,is mainly played during the murders.Keinszig is assaulted by Vincent&apos;s men. His body is hanged over the bridge,to make his death an apparent suicide. Archbishop Gilday has the tea of the pope poisoned. The pope soon drinks it and dies. Don Altobello eats a dish of poisoned cannoli that his goddaughter Connie serves him. He soon dies silently at the opera as Connie watches through her opera glasses. Al Neri shoots Archbishop Gilday as he climbs a spiral staircase and flings the archbishop&apos;s body down the stairs. Finally,Calo approaches Don Lucchesi and whispers to his ear &quot;Power wears out those who do not have it&quot; before stabbing Lucchesi in the throat with his own pair of glasses,killing him. Calo himself is killed.The assassin hired by Don Altobello to kill Michael,Mosca,descends upon the opera house during Anthony&apos;s performance,killing two of Vincent&apos;s men who delay his opportunity,and the opera ends before he has the chance to kill Michael with his rifle. The assassin retreats to the opera house facade&apos;s staircase,and tries to shoot Michael there. Mary is confronting her father about the forced break-up with Vincent,when two shots ring out. The first hits Michael in the shoulder. The second hits Mary in the chest,and she dies calling out to her father,&quot;Dad?&quot; Vincent then kills the assassin with a single shot,striking him in the chest. As Kay cradles Mary&apos;s bloody body in her arms,Michael screams with primal pain and rage.The scene dissolves to a short montage of Michael&apos;s memories,the first being a dance with Mary,the second being a dance with his first wife,Apollonia,and the last being a dance with Kay. The film ends in an unspecified year,showing an aged and broken Michael,seated in the front yard of his Sicilian villa. He slowly puts on a pair of sunglasses,drops an orange from his hand,slumps out of his chair,collapses to the ground,and slowly dies,completely alone. A small dog sniffs around his body and the screen fades to black as Mascagni&apos;s &quot;Intermezzo&quot; resolves to a high F major chord.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film opens in New York. People start to get confused in Central Park,repeating their words,standing still and sometimes walking backwards (Scott Troost). We hear a few screams. A woman (Alison Folland) reading on a bench takes her silver chopstick-style hair pin out of her hair and stabs herself in the neck with it. Meanwhile on a building site,workers (Curtis McClarin,Michael Den Dekker) on the ground are chatting when all of a sudden a body falls. Panicked,thinking the worker just fell off the roof by mistake,they rush over to his broken body. While they looked over the body,another thud,another worker. They look at him (Cornell Womack) confused; one is possible,two is unlikely,and when the third falls,it seems impossible. Then yet another and another,crashing to earth. When they look up they see many running off the edge,apparently by their own will,looking completely calm,and sure of their actions.In the next shot,we see a science teacher named Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg),talking about the event science can not explain about thousands of disappearing bees,no bodies left,no trace. A student offers the opinion that this is a natural event that we will never fully understand. Several students (Sophie Burke,Alex Van Kooy,Charlie Saxton) start to speculate on the phenomenon that is the disappearing bees,when Elliot is suddenly called out of class to a staff meeting warning about an apparent &quot;terrorist attack&quot; in New York in which terrorists have apparently released some kind of gas in Central Park,and advising that school is cancelled. As they leave,Elliot confesses to his friend Julian (John Leguizamo),a math teacher,that he and his wife are having some problems.Elliot and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) flee Philadelphia on a train,with Julian,and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). On the train people start to get reports by cellphone that the attacks have been reported at their destination,and in many other places. Alma is getting repeated and insistant calls on her phone from someone called Joey (M. Night Shyamalan&apos;s voice),and she lies to Elliot about it.The movie moves on to show Rittenhouse Park in Philadelphia,where a woman (Jann Ellis) walks her dog and a breeze begins to blow. A traffic cop (Don Castro) walking through a traffic jam stops and comments to a taxi driver called Sal (Bill Chemerka) about the chilly weather. Suddenly everyone stops in their tracks,and the dog runs across the road after his leash drops to the ground,leading us back to the cop who is now standing still in front of the cab. A gunshot rings out and he drops to the ground. As blood spurts from a bullet wound on his forehead,the taxi driver gets out,walks over to the dead cop,picks up the gun from beside the body and shoots himself in the forehead as well. A woman in high heels steps off the sidewalk,picks up the gun again and we hear another gunshot.The train ends up leaving Elliott,Alma,Julian,Jess,and all the other passengers in a small rural town,as the conductors have lost radio contact with everyone else. At a diner they see a newscast that suggests the suicides are not caused by a terrorist attack,but by a natural phenomena. A reporter says that the toxin switches off the part of the brain that keeps us from harming ourselves.Julian has by now lost phone contact with his wife (who was visiting Princeton) and starts to panic as some lady shows Elliot a youtube type video she was sent on her iphone,showing a man walk into a lion&apos;s den at a zoo,and taunting the lions with his hands to try to get them to attack him (there&apos;s a graphic shot of him staggering with both his arms eaten off). Julian finds a lift with some people heading to Princeton; he leaves Jess with Elliot and Alma. When he gets there Princeton is also infected,and there are dozens of people hanging from trees over the road. The driver of the car crashes deliberately into a tree at high speed and Julian slashes his wrists with broken windscreen glass and dies (this is the one time you don&apos;t see anything graphic - the camera cuts away and we see less than the scene in the red band trailer; where you can see Julian bleeding from the wrists).Meanwhile Elliot and Alma decide,along with everybody else,to flee for the state line with Jess,as the attacks seem only to be affecting the northeast US. A nice couple who run a plant nursery offer to take them in their car. The man suggests to Elliot and Alma that the toxin is produced by plants. He explains the way plants can communicate with other plants,and the way they can release chemicals to get rid of specific pests.While trying to reach the state line they see bodies ahead in the road. Turning back they meet many other cars,all converging on a country road junction; all report bodies back the way they have come. Organized by an army private they abandon the cars and strike out on foot,heading for a small remote housing development one man who happens to be a realtor (Joel de la Fuente) knows about. It&apos;s new and small and not on any maps except local ones,so they hope it will be safe from the terrorists since it appears they are focusing on large cities and roads.From the junction one group leaves immediately,but most take a minute to get things from their cars,so walking across the fields they are in two groups. The smaller group (10-12 people),with Elliot,Alma and Jess,is in front. The larger (20-25 people),including the soldier and the plant couple,is behind them by 3 or 4 minutes. This larger group gets infected,and the soldier become delusional (shouting something about how he is a soldier and his gun is his friend,and he will not leave it). Then Elliot&apos;s group hears the gunshots as one by one they (presumably) use the soldier&apos;s gun to kill themselves. Elliot starts to believe that it is indeed the plants,and that the toxin is triggered by large groups of people. He yells at everyone to split up into smaller groups,and the group peels off into three smaller groups,all running away in different directions.Alma tells Elliot that if they are going to die,she wants to tell him something. One night,when she had told Elliot she was working late,she actually went out for tiramisu with Joey from work; but that&apos;s all that happened.After walking for a bit,Elliot counters with the fact that he finds the girl who works at the local pharmacy very attractive,and sometimes he buys cough syrup from her even when he doesn&apos;t have a cough: he later confesses he made this up.Elliot,Alma,Jess,and two teenagers find a showhome for the new development. There is some comic relief as Elliot talks to a plant he sees blowing inside,and introduces himself,saying he is giving good vibes so it won&apos;t harm him. It turns out the plant is plastic,but he keeps talking for a little just in case - feeling like an idiot. As they leave they look back,and see two small groups of people arrive at the showhome,forming one larger group (12-15 people approx). That many people trigger the toxin,and they stand around confused,except for one man who starts up a large commercial lawnmower,then lies in the grass in front of it as it rips him apart. (We assumed the camera would cut away,but it doesn&apos;t! As previously stated,this movie is extremely graphic!)Our five people all end up on the front porch of a boarded-up house,asking for food,while Jess plays on a rope swing suspended from a tree branch (the swing and the tree seemed very chilling and climactic,but nothing actually happened). The inhabitants of the house refuse to offer food or shelter,and the two teenagers start to get very aggressive,kicking at the door and shouting at the people inside. The inhabitants shoot the two teenagers dead: one through the chest and the second through the head. Elliot is horrified.Elliot,Alma and Jess move on till they find an old house with no power,which they think is abandoned. A spooky old lady (Betty Buckley) lives there,who chooses to remain out of contact with the whole world. She doesn&apos;t want to know about the event in the outside world; however,she gives them supper and a bed for the night.We (the audience) see a newscast discussing the toxin (our protagonists don&apos;t,as the house has no TV). A scientist is suggesting that judging from the severity and number of the attacks,and assuming some similarities to other kinds of natural toxins like ocean algae,the attacks will peak at 9am the next day,and very quickly fall away to nothing following that (there&apos;s a graph that shows a drastic tail-off of toxin activity).In the morning when Elliot wakes up the old lady tells him that he,Alma and Jess have to leave (she seems completely bonkers). She then goes outside into the garden,pauses,and starts walking backwards; the toxin has affected her. As Elliott cowers inside the house the old lady walks around the porch and headbutts the walls,and eventually the window,leaving glass splinters in her face and eye,and also letting in the wind (and the toxin).Elliot runs through the house trying to find Alma and Jess. He can hear them,but can&apos;t locate them. He thinks he hears them in the cellar,but when he goes in he is alone. Alma and Jess are actually outside in an old stone spring house (a remnant from the pre-Civil War Underground Railway). A speaking tube between the spring house and the cellar has transmitted their voices as clearly as if they were right next to Elliott; and Elliott can talk to them through this. He explains that the toxin now seems to be set off by even one person alone.Elliot decides that if he is going to die he doesn&apos;t want to die alone. They all leave their safe hiding places and walk into the middle of the garden and hold hands. The wind blows. Nothing happens. IT had ended.Three months later and they are all living back in Philly (which looks business as usual; while the streets are fairly empty,there are cars driving around,and people walking on the sidewalks). Jess is off to school by bus. Alma is doing a pregnancy test; it&apos;s positive,and Elliot hugs her and looks delighted. On the TV is a scientist warning that the event was like a red tide; the first sign that the planet is rejecting humans as pests. The host says that if that were true it would be happening in other places.Cut to the gardens at the Jardins du Louvre in Paris,France. Two guys (Stéphane Debac &amp; Cyrille Thouvenin) are walking discussing plans for after work that evening. Cue distant scream; one guy starts to repeat his words about a bike,everyone stands still; other guy says (in French) &quot;Oh my God&quot;.End credits.</Plot>

        <Plot>Wes Craven produces this remake of his 1977 classic of the same name,about the Carters,an idyllic American family travelling through the great American southwest. But their trip takes a detour into an area closed off from the public,but more importantly from society. An area originally used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing that was intended to be empty...or so they thought? When the Carter&apos;s car breaks down at the old site,they&apos;re stranded...or are they? As the Carters may soon realize that what seemed like a car casually breaking down,might actually be a trap. This trap might be perpetrated by the inhabitants of the site who aren&apos;t pulling a prank,but are out to set up a gruesome massacre.</Plot>

        <Plot>In the green woods of Silver Falls,Oregon,Aaron Hallam,a trained assassin AWOL from the Special Forces,keeps his own brand of wildlife vigil. After Hallam brutally slew four deer hunters in the area,FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement,he&apos;s closed off to his past,the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slaying is the work of a man he trained,he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone,L.T. enters the woods,unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron&apos;s tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help,Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And,even as they go into their final combat against each other,neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with Interpol agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) standing outside in the pouring rain in Berlin,Germany. Across the street,his partner Thomas Schumer (Ian Burfield) meets with AndrÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© Clement (Georges Bigot) in a car. Clement talks to Schumer about how the International Bank of Business &amp; Credit (IBBC) is going to purchase missiles in a deal with China. Both men smoke cigarettes,but Clement remains adamant that the windows stay down. Schumer tells him that they can protect him if he turns on the bank. Clement says that he&apos;ll think about it and contact him later. Schumer exits the car and Clement drives away. Schumer calls someone and is excited that Clement is going to be their informant,so they can take down the bank. Schumer walks to the road as people walk around him. He signals to Salinger on the opposite side,but then suddenly clutches his arm. Schumer vomits and collapses on the ground. Salinger rushes over through the busy street,but has his head smashed by a side-view mirror of a panel van. Salinger goes down,hearing nothing but a ringing noise,looking directly into Schumer&apos;s dead eyes.Salinger is checked out by a doctor in a hospital,who recommends that he stay overnight so that they can keep an eye on him. Salinger refuses and requests to see Schumer&apos;s body. Salinger goes to the morgue and inspects the body. It appears as though Schumer suffered a fatal heart attack,but Salinger doesn&apos;t believe it. He thoroughly inspects the body and has the coroner help turn Schumer on his chest. While inspecting his back,Salinger finds a small lesion. He tells the coroner to conduct a full autopsy. Meanwhile,in New York,District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) tries to contact Schumer to get an update on how the meet went,but she can&apos;t reach him. Salinger calls her office and tells her that Schumer is dead. He also tells her to come to Berlin so that they can meet with police officials. Salinger and Whitman meet the police officials and try to convince them that Schumer was assassinated. The autopsy report found a small trace of prussic acid and cyanide in Schumer&apos;s body. For the poison to kill him that quickly,it had to have been administered only a minute or so before. Salinger saw the whole thing but didn&apos;t notice who the killer was. The police question Salinger about why he and his partner were in Berlin. Whitman explains that Interpol is investigating the IBBC for being the bank of choice for money laundering all over the world,while also participating in other illegal dealings (murder,weapons buying,e.t.c). Whitman is involved because the New York branch of the IBBC is where they primarily do their shady dealings. Everyone who has tried to testify against the bank has been either murdered or disappeared completely. The police don&apos;t see any evidence against the bank,and so they tell Salinger and Whitman to go home. They also inform Salinger that they&apos;ve read his dossier,and tell him not to make the same mistake he made in Scotland Yard. As they leave,Whitman asks Salinger what the police meant by Salinger&apos;s past. He just tells her to read his dossier as well.Salinger goes back to his home in Lyon and fills a sink full of ice water. As he dunks his head into the sink,he recalls Schumer&apos;s death and remembers a man (the assassin) bumping into him after he got out of the car. The next day,Salinger&apos;s boss arrives at Interpol headquarters and is surprised to find Salinger there so early. Salinger is determined to bring down the IBBC. He found a newspaper article about Clement having a freak accident while driving home,the same day Schumer was killed. With Clement dead,they no longer have an informant. Jonas Skarssen (Ulrich Thomsen),the head of the IBBC,gave a statement to the police about Clement. He says that Clement was at his house working on something and then left before he was found dead. Salinger found that Skarssen was lying about the time he said Clement arrived at his house. Salinger wants to talk to Skarssen and try to catch him in his lie (then start to build the case again). Meanwhile,the assassin (Brian F. O&apos;Byrne) meets his handler Wilhelm Wexler (Armin Mueller-Stahl) at a museum. Wexler finds that the assassin is fixated on a particular painting,and asks him why he likes it. The assassin replies that its because he can see the agony on the peoples faces,and agony is real. Wexler gives him another assignment on a USB key. The assassin hesitates at first,but decides to take the job.Salinger goes to the IBBC headquarters for his meeting with Skarssen. While waiting,he sees Skarssen walking/talking with a group of men,including Wexler. Salinger shouts out to get Skarssen to talk to him,but is ignored. Salinger is brought into a room and is introduced to Martin White (Patrick Baladi). White is Skarssens attorney,and he has also brought the bank&apos;s attorney to join their meeting. If Salinger wants to talk to Skarssen,he will have to talk to White first. Salinger is pissed that he&apos;s being jerked around,but stays for the meeting. He questions White about the time Clement arrived at Skarssens house,and White gives the wrong time. Salinger calls him on lying and tells him that the police report he has states a different time. The bank&apos;s attorney inspects the report,and then pulls out another report. He says that the report Salinger has was a preliminary draft,and so has errors. The official report,which is in his hand,says that the time White gave is correct. Defeated,Salinger leaves the headquarters and calls Whitman on the phone. He says that they changed the report and theres nothing he can do. While talking,someone bumps into Salinger and walks towards the bank. Salinger freaks out,thinking that hes been poisoned as well,and confronts the person who bumped into him. It turns out to be an innocent woman,who thinks that Salinger is crazy.Salinger visits his boss at home and tries to get him to come outside. His boss refuses,and so Salinger makes his way into the house. He smashes his boss phone to pieces and pulls out a hidden wiretap from it. They go outside,and Salinger says that he also found a wiretap in his phone. The bank bugged them,which is why they wrote up a new report before Salinger went to visit. Meanwhile,Whitman calls Clements widow and tries to question her about her husband,but she hangs up. She leaves a message for her,giving her cell phone number and telling her to talk. The widow picks up the phone and says that she doesn&apos;t know anything about why her husband was killed. She hangs up again,but then text messages Whitman&apos;s cell phone. They reply back and forth,and the widow tells Whitman to talk to Umberto Calvini (Luca Barbareschi). Also,during this time,we see the assassin practice firing at a target a certain distance away. He then carefully loads the bullet shell into a container to save for later. Salinger looks into Calvini and finds that he is the head of a weapon&apos;s industry corporation. He also is running for Prime Minister in Italy. Salinger and Whitman travel to Milan to question him about Clement and the IBBC. Meanwhile,we see a couple of exchanges,ending with a package being handed over to a uniformed senior cop. Salinger and Whitman show up at a political rally,where Calvini will give a speech. They enter a nearby building to meet Calvini. While waiting,Whitman says that she read Salinger&apos;s dossier and found out what happened to make him quit Scotland Yard and join Interpol. He had found a good informant in the IBBC to help him bring them down,but the IBBC got to his informant and made it appear as though he was unreliable. They then caused the informant and his family to die in a car accident. Everyone wrote Salinger off and they buried the case. They meet Calvini,and he candidly explains that the IBBC has purchased a bunch of missiles from China to sell to another country. They then came to him to buy guidance systems because he&apos;s only one of two people in the world who can supply them. However,Calvini refused to do business with them and turned them down. Clement was his friend in the IBBC. Calvini warns Salinger and Whitman that the IBBC control everything and everyone. They supply countries with weapons to control the wars,which makes them control the debt in war zones. He promises to talk more with them after the rally is over.Calvini goes outside and attends the rally. Salinger,Whitman,and an Italian detective decide to get some drinks at a bar next door while they wait. In a nearby hotel,we see a hitman setting up a rifle and aiming for the stage. Calvini starts to give his speech,and the hitman sets off a countdown for sixty seconds. When the minute is over,he tries to shoot Calvini&apos;s head but misses due to a sudden movement. Immediately after,a second shot is fired and Calvini is shot in the head. The hitman is confused,since he didn&apos;t fire the second shot. The crowd panics and everyone runs off. The uniformedcop from earlier blasts his way into the hitman&apos;s hotel room and pumps him full of bullets. After his colleagues leave,the cop shoots the hitman in the head to finish him off. He then plants the shell that the assassin fired earlier on the floor. Salinger runs to the hotel while Whitman and the cop follow. While everyone flees,Salinger spots the assassin. He follows after him through an alley,but loses him once they get to the backstreet. Whitman and the detective also get to the street. Whitman sees the assassin in a car and slowly approaches. The assassin starts up the car,crashes into Whitman,and speeds off. Salinger and the detective are shocked and rush over to her. She appears to be fine,and the detective gives Salinger his gun,telling him to pursue the assassin. Salinger runs on foot and eventually comes to a crowded intersection. He spots the broken windshield of the car and approaches it,but finds that the assassin has escaped.Whitman is checked out at the hospital and is fine apart from some bruises. Salinger and Whitman go back to the rally site,which has been sealed off by police. They are let through and begin to inspect the stage. They notice that the trajectories of the two bullets fired are different from one another. They go onto the roof of the hotel where the hitman was killed and Salinger realizes what happened. The assassin was on the roof,with the hitman a couple of stories below. They both set off a countdown for sixty seconds once Calvini started to talk. When the hitman missed,the assassin fired and got the head shot. The second bullet shell in the hotel room was placed to look like the hitman was alone and fired both shots. And since the hitman was connected to the Red Brigade,Calvini&apos;s death looks like a political assassination. As Salinger visualizes how the assassin got away,he comes across a puddle on the roof. He has the cops drain the water and then they find the footprint of the assassin in it. Salinger recognizes the footprint from a murder years ago,and realizes that the IBBC keeps on using the same assassin. Also,due to the footprint,they determine that he uses a leg brace to walk. If they can get to the assassin and turn him,they can bring down the bank. The corrupt cop shows up and informs them that their superiors have ordered them back home. Their investigation is hereby closed. Salinger and Whitman go to the airport and can&apos;t believe they&apos;re being shafted like this. As they say goodbye to their cop friend,Whitman notices the metal detector nearby. If the assassin left through the airport,he would&apos;ve had to show his leg brace once he stepped through the metal detector. They review the security footage and find that sure enough the assassin was there earlier,but since he was aware of the camera he had his head turned away (so they dont have a clear image of his face). They find that he went on an airplane to New York,and so they head on the next flight to NYC.Once Salinger and Whitman arrive,they are greeted by NYPD detectives,Iggy Ornelas (Felix Solis) and Bernie Ward (Jack McGee). The detectives managed to get a clear screenshot of the assassin&apos;s face when he landed in New York. And since he has a leg brace,he must have been a particular doctor&apos;s patient to get the shoes that he&apos;s wearing. Meanwhile,we see the assassin running on a treadmill at a gym. Salinger,Ornelas,and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson (Tibor Feldman). They go to his apartment and knock on the door. He answers,but then shuts the door,saying that he has&apos;nt done anything and seems nervous at lettimg them into his apartment. Salinger scares Isaacson into cooperating with them by saying that the assassin kills doctors. Elsewhere,Skarssen is at home playing the asian strategy game Go with his son when he gets a video conference call from White,Wexler,and his senior staff. It&apos;s revealed that they had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his son&apos;s for the guidance equipment for the weapons. They also know that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin. It is decided that they won&apos;t allow anything to mess up their deal with the Calvinis.Salinger and the detectives look through all of Isaacson&apos;s patient files for those who have the specific leg braces. One file has a dead phone number listed and no photo of the patient. Also in the file is an address,which was where he would get dropped off by a taxi every time he left the office. Whitman&apos;s boss chastises her for wasting time on the IBBC case and tells her they have 1 more chance. Salinger,Ornelas,and Ward go to the address but find that its an empty lot. Still,they figure that the assassin must live around there. Ornelas goes to get some coffee and as he pays,he spots the assassin walking down the street. Ornelas runs out of the store and gets Salinger and Ward. They follow him through the streets until he stops at a payphone. He calls someone,and tells him to meet at the Guggenheim Museum. Salinger and the detectives follow the assassin to the Guggenheim and blend in with the crowd. Wexler shows up and Salinger recognizes him from before. Wexler tells the assassin that Salinger is his next target,since he&apos;s getting too close to them. Wexler leaves and Ornelas follows him. The assassin gets ready to leave when he sees a reflection of Salinger and Ward spying on him. Salinger realizes that they&apos;re blown and so they confront the assassin. They hold him at gunpoint and prepare to arrest him,but the assassin says that the bank will never let them bring him in. The assassin is suddenly shot in the chest and falls over. A gunman shoots Ward in the throat,causing him to fall onto Salinger. Ward bleeds all over Salinger and painfully dies. The gunman is about to kill Salinger when the assassin shoots him through the forehead. It turns out that a whole hit team is in the museum,and a massive shootout ensues. Salinger grabs Ward&apos;s gun and kills some henchmen. The assassin also saves Salinger from being killed again. The assassin was wearing a bulletproof vest,and so he&apos;s unharmed from being shot before. He tells Salinger that they need to get out the museum,since the hit team is meant for both of them.During the shootout,Salinger is wounded in the side of his face. He and the assassin realize that the only way out of the museum is the spiral ramp,which is scattered with hitmen. They try to shoot their way out floor-by-floor,but keep on getting held down. Salinger shoots a hitman and tries to grab his gun,but the hitman fights him over it. Salinger shoves his finger into the hitmans bullet wound and causes him to unload his machine gun into the roof,showering the museum with glass. Salinger manages to shove the hitman over the balcony,where he falls to his death. The assassin is shot in the hand,and then four times in the stomach. Salinger smacks him around to make sure he doesn&apos;t die,and then shoots out a giant ceiling piece,causing it to crush some gunmen below. Salinger and the assassin manage to elude the last two gunmen and escape from the museum shortly before the police arrive. Salinger carries the assassin to a nearby park,and the assassin says that he was right all along they would never allow him to be taken into custody. The assassin dies,and Salinger is found by the police.Whitman visits Salinger at the police station,where a detective tells them that the cops were told to detain both of them. Whitman and Salinger manage to escape from the police station and drive off. Whitman shows Salinger a file and drives him to a building,where Ornelas is waiting for them. He caught up with Wexler and is keeping him downstairs. He tells Salinger to turn Wexler so that Ward didn&apos;t die for nothing. Salinger goes downstairs and meets Wexler. He knows that he was the assassin&apos;s handler and knows that he set him up to die. Wexler says that the reason why Salinger failed to bring down the IBBC and will continue to fail is because the IBBC controls everyone. All government agencies and criminals invest in the bank so that they can do things outside the law. Wexler was a former East German communist secret police and Salinger is puzzled how he came to be so dedicated to a western bank. Wexler wearily hints at selling out his beliefs and is not happy anymore. To bring down the bank,Wexler tells Salinger he will have to also go outside the law. Salinger tells Whitman to walk away from the case and write him off. She wants to see the case through to the end,but Salinger says that the bank will go after her family. Its better if he goes at it by himself. Whitman eventually agrees and says goodbye.The IBBC lawyer White and others go to the Calvini organization to sign the contract for the guidance equipment. However,the Calvini security team suddenly shows up and orders White and his guys to leave immediately. It turns out that Salinger informed the Calvini sons that the IBBC assassinated their father. While driving away,White is informed that the Calvinis know about the assassination. Whites car enters a tunnel,but doesn&apos;t come out. Later on,while watching a news segment on a general staging a coup de tat (which the IBBC supported),Skarssen sees a report about White&apos;s death. He realizes that the Calvinis are sending them a message,but reassures his colleagues that everything will move ahead. So instead of buying the guidance equipment from Calvini,they will have to buy it from Ahment Sunay (Haluk Bilginer) in Turkey. Currently,Sunay is in Istanbul for his cousin&apos;s funeral. Skarssen plans to travel there to negotiate a deal. Wexler calls Salinger and tells him that the meet is in Istanbul.In Istanbul,Skarssen and Wexler arrive at the funeral. While waiting for Sunay,Wexler excuses himself to use the bathroom. Salinger is waiting in the bathroom with an earpiece. Wexler planted a bug on Skarssens jacket,so when they meet Sunay Salinger will be able to record their conversation. Sunay greets Wexler and Skarssen while Salinger watches from afar. Sunay has Wexler wait outside while he takes Skarssen into a building to talk business. Salinger sneaks into the building because he has to be within a certain level of distance to hear the conversation. However,he&apos;s soon discovered by guards and thrown out. Meanwhile,a man approaches Wexler. He looks up and knows what&apos;s going to happen next. After negotiating,Skarssen goes outside and finds Wexler slumped against a pillar. He tells him to wake up,but then notices a hole in his jacket. Skarssen opens his jacket to find that Wexler has been shot and killed. He then panics upon seeing Salinger,who starts to approach him. Salinger grabs Wexler&apos;s gun and stalks Skarssen through busy markets. Skarssen tries to shake him,but Salinger continues to follow him. Scared,he runs onto a rooftop and flees. A part in the roof is destroyed,and so he can&apos;t run any further. Salinger,gun in hand,introduces himself. Skarssen says that he doesn&apos;t have the authority to arrest him. Salinger says who said anything about arresting you? and aims the gun at him. Skarssen says that if he kills him,it will solve nothing. Someone else will take his place,and the IBBC and 150 other bacnks will continue to thrive. If Salinger were to kill him,it would only quench his blood thirst. As Salinger contemplates killing Skarssen,a shot is fired. Skarssen is shot in the chest and collapses on the roof. A gun is then held to the back of Salingers head. The shooter is the same man who killed Wexler. He takes Salinger&apos;s gun away,and then walks down to where Skarssen is barely alive. He shoots Skarssen again,this time in the head to finish him off,&quot;with greetings from Mario and Enzo Calvini&quot;. The film ends with the hitman walking away,telling Salinger &quot;Grazie&quot; (Italian for thankyou).During the end credits,we see newspaper headlines about Skarssen&apos;s death. He was replaced by one of his colleagues,who continued the illegal activities of the IBBC while making it appear as though they are a clean bank. The last newspaper clipping says that Whitman,in a promoted position in Washington,is going to perform another investigation into the IBBC.</Plot>

        <Plot>After the death of his father King George V (Michael Gambon) and the scandalous abdication of King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), Bertie (Colin Firth) who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King George VI of England. With his country on the brink of war and in desperate need of a leader, his wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), the future Queen Mother, arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). After a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment and eventually form an unbreakable bond. With the support of Logue, his family, his government and Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall), the King will overcome his stammer and deliver a radio-address that inspires his people and unites them in battle. Based on the true story of King George VI, &quot;The King&apos;s Speech&quot; follows the Royal Monarch&apos;s quest to find his voice.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film&apos;s events immediately follow those of The Matrix Reloaded and assume familiarity with the story of the prior two films.Bane/Smith and Neo are both in an unconscious state. The former is said to be merely asleep,whereas neural patterns of Neo are identical to those of people who are connected to the Matrix. Morpheus,dispirited after the destruction of the Nebuchadnezzar and discovering the true nature of the Prophecy at the end of the last film,starts a search for Neo within the Matrix despite him not being jacked in. Neo is in fact trapped in a limbo: a subway station named &quot;Mobil Avenue&quot; that is a transition zone between the Matrix and the Source (the Machine mainframe). &quot;Mobil&quot; is notably an anagram for &quot;Limbo&quot;. At this station,Neo meets a &apos;family&apos; of programs(of Indian Origin). The little girl called Sati talks to Neo. Father tells Neo that Mobil Avenue is controlled by a program called The Trainman who,in turn,is an exile loyal only to The Merovingian. When Neo tries to board the train with the family,the Trainman refuses,and knocks him away from the train.Seraph contacts Morpheus on behalf of the Oracle,who now resides in a different &quot;shell&quot; (see Cast,above). The Oracle informs Morpheus and Trinity of Neo being trapped in Mobil Avenue. Seraph,Morpheus,and Trinity pursue the Trainman to secure Neo&apos;s release,but he escapes. The trio enter Club Hel to confront the Merovingian for Neo&apos;s freedom. The Merovingian demands &quot;the eyes of the Oracle&quot; in exchange for Neo&apos;s release. Trinity however loses her patience and provokes a Mexican standoff in which she,Morpheus,Seraph and the Merovingian all have a gun to their head,thus forcing the Merovingian to release Neo.Troubled by new visions of the Machine City,Neo decides to visit the Oracle one last time before returning to the real world. She informs him that as the One,upon visiting the Source (the Machine mainframe),he developed a connection with it. The Matrix and the rest of the Machine world,are derived from the Source as well. Thus we learn that all of Neo&apos;s abilities - both in and out of the Matrix - exist because of this connection. This is how Neo was able to stop the machines giving pursuit after the Nebuchadnezzar was destroyed in The Matrix Reloaded,although the end result of his lack of preparation was temporary confinement in Mobil Avenue. She characterizes Smith (who is also growing in power) as his exact &quot;opposite&quot; and his &quot;negative&quot;. She also elaborates upon the relationship between her and the Architect (tellingly,each of them ejects an exasperated &quot;Please!&quot; when Neo asks them about the other). She also tells Neo cryptically that &quot;everything that has a beginning has an end&quot; and warns that Smith&apos;s power threatens not only the Matrix,but also the Source and eventually the Machine City. The Oracle states that the war is about to end &quot;one way or another.&quot;After Neo takes leave of the Oracle,a large group of Smith clones arrive at her home. They successfully assimilate the unresisting Oracle,and having gained her powers of precognition,the new Smith cackles maniacally at the future he is seeing.In the real world,the remaining crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and the Mjolnir (referred to by the characters as &quot;the Hammer&quot;) encounter Niobe&apos;s deactivated ship,the Logos and its crew (whose ordeal is portrayed in the game Enter The Matrix). They successfully reactivate the ship and begin to interrogate the now awakened Bane,who claims he has no memory of the events of the earlier battle. After contemplating his visions,Neo announces that he needs a ship to travel to the Machine City,although he cannot explain why. Roland,the Mjolnir&apos;s captain refuses him but Niobe (who was told by the Oracle in Enter The Matrix that she would have to make a choice to help Neo or not),lets him take the Logos. Trinity decides to accompany Neo.The two remaining crews plan to return to Zion,and avoid the Sentinel army by allowing Niobe to pilot the Mjolnir through a series of service tunnels,which are nearly impossible to navigate. Shortly after departure,the Mjolnir&apos;s crew discover that Bane has murdered a crew member and has hidden aboard the Logos. However they are unable to double-back in order to warn Trinity and Neo. Before the Logos can depart,Bane ambushes Trinity and takes her hostage. Neo fights Bane,who reveals himself as a manifestation of Smith. During the struggle,Bane manages to blind Neo by cauterizing his eyes with a severed electric cable. As Bane appears to have the upper hand,he closes in on Neo - only to have his attack thwarted and reversed. Neo can see Smith inside Bane as a fiery form,in spite of his blindness. Neo finishes the fight by smashing Bane&apos;s head with a jackhandle and releases Trinity,who pilots them towards the Machine City.In Zion,the defenders deploy infantry armed with rocket launchers and Armored Personnel Units in order to protect the dock from assault. The dock is invaded by a massive horde of Sentinels as well as two giant drilling machines,igniting The Battle of Zion. The APUs however fail in keeping the Dock,and the humans are pushed back into the temple. Captain Mifune fails to open the gate for the approaching Mjolnir. With his last breath he tells Kid (who was renewing his ammunition supply at the time),to open the gate for the Mjolnir. Kid is reluctant at first,saying he did not complete the combat training needed,only for Mifune to tell him,&quot;Neither did I.&quot; This gives Kid the courage to fight through a cloud of Sentinels to the gate. Just as the remaining humans are about to be overwhelmed,the Mjolnir arrives at Zion,with further Sentinels shortly behind,setting off an EMP which disables all electronic equipment in the area. The EMP destroys all the present Sentinels,but it also disables the remainder of Zion&apos;s defenses. The humans are forced to fall back to the temple entrance and wait for the next swarm.Nearing the Machine City,Neo and Trinity are attacked by the city&apos;s defense system,which hurls numerous mobile bombs and Sentinels at the Logos. Neo uses the power given by his connection to the Source to destroy the incoming bombs. However,Sentinels overwhelm the ship. To evade them Trinity flies the Logos up into an electrical storm cloud. The Sentinels are disabled,but the cloud also disables the ship&apos;s engines. As the ship emerges temporarily above the cloud layer,Trinity gets a glimpse of real sunlight and blue sky. The ship then stalls and plummets back into the storm cloud as it free-falls directly toward the Machine City. Trinity attempts to ignite the engines but it is too late and the ship crashes into a machine tower. The impact of the collision fatally wounds Trinity,and she dies in Neo&apos;s arms.Neo emerges into the Machine City to strike a bargain with the machines,personified by the Deus Ex Machina. Neo warns the machines that Smith (who has by now assimilated every human and programme within the Matrix) is beyond the machines&apos; control,and will soon assault the Source to which the Matrix is connected. He offers to help stop Smith in exchange for a ceasefire on Zion. The second wave of Sentinels attacking Zion instantly responds by standing down while the Machines provide a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix and confront Smith. The city is now wholly populated by Smith copies - the clone with the Oracle&apos;s powers steps forth,claiming he has already foreseen his own victory.The city&apos;s population of Smiths stands by and watches while Neo and Smith square off. Fighting on the streets,through buildings and into the sky,they finally brawl in a flooded crater. Neo is eventually outmatched by Smith,who pauses to gloat that he has &quot;seen this [the details of his victory] before&quot;. Describing the details aloud,he cannot remember what he was supposed to say next in his vision. Neo refuses to give up the fight,and a frustrated Smith continues his attack until Neo is too badly hurt to go on. To both Smith and Neo&apos;s surprise,Smith announces &quot;everything that has a beginning has an end.&quot; Hearing the Oracle&apos;s parting advice again allows Neo to understand that Smith&apos;s assimilation is not total,and baits the scared Smith into assimilating him. Neo&apos;s final words to Smith are,&quot;It was inevitable,&quot; quoting Smith&apos;s oft-spoken admonition.Smith&apos;s assimilation of Neo is seemingly successful,and when the Oracle-Smith asks Neo-Smith whether it is over,he receives a nod and smile as reply. Back in the Machine city,Neo&apos;s body spasms as a surge of energy enters his body through the Matrix connection. Neo is returning to the source,and starting with the Neo copy of Smith,a white light begins to rip the clones apart from the inside out. One by one,similar to the destruction of Agent Smith at the end of The Matrix,the copies are destroyed.With the elimination of the Smiths,all the programs and humans that were possessed return to normal,including the Oracle. The Sentinels that were about to attack the humans withdraw from Zion. Neo,having sacrificed himself to save both the Machines and humans,is unplugged from the Matrix and his body is respectfully carried away by the Machines.The Architect,upon meeting the Oracle,tells her that she &quot;played a very dangerous game&quot; by attempting to change the way the Matrix functioned. The Oracle responds by saying that she understood the risk and knew it was worth taking. She asks the Architect what will become of any humans who want to be unplugged from the Matrix,and the Architect replies that &quot;they will be freed.&quot; The Oracle asks the Architect,&quot;Do I have your word?&quot; The Architect answers &quot;What do you think I am? Human?&quot;The closing shot of the film depicts a new dawn on the world of the Matrix,created by Sati. Plant life is shown in the Matrix,and for the first (and last) time the ubiquitous green tint is absent.</Plot>

        <Plot>Brad Pitt has been working for a mobster who is in prison because Pitt accidentally ran a red light and hit the mobster&apos;s car. When the police arrived,they found a body in the mobster&apos;s trunk. The guy was alive but was obviously going to be murdered. The mobster was sentenced to 5 years in prison. Pitt has been forced to work for the mobster to pay for having caused him to go to prison.Julia Roberts is Pitt&apos;s girlfriend and they have been having difficulties with their relationship. Roberts now wants to go to Vegas but Pitt has to make one last trip for the mobster or he will be killed. Roberts throws Pitt out and heads to Vegas alone and Pitt heads to Mexico on his last mission.Pitt has been given orders by the 2nd in command (Bob Balaban) to pick up a gun called &quot;The Mexican&quot; and bring it back. Pitt gets to Mexico and picks up the gun but unfortunately,the man he gets it from is accidentally killed by a stray bullet fired during a Mexican celebration.Pitt calls Balaban and reports the problem and while he&apos;s on the phone,his car is stolen,gun and all. Pitt sets out after the car to try and retrieve the gun.Meanwhile,on the way to Vegas Roberts is in a restroom when a gunman grabs her and before anything happens,James Gandolfini saves her by shooting the man. Gandolfini claims that he is working for the mobster and that his name is Leroy. He is a very sensitive,gay psychotic killer who is there to protect Roberts.They get to Vegas and along the way Gandolfini picks up a gay postal worker who spends a romantic evening with Gandolfini. In the morning roberts and Gandolfini go out for breakfast and while they&apos;re eating,the gunman goes to their hotel room and kills the postal worker by throwing him off the balcony. roberts and Gandolfini get back and this time Gandolfini shoots the man in the head to kill him for good.Roberts and Gandolfini are told by Balaban to head to Mexico and meet Pitt because things have gone wrong.In Mexico,Pitt has recovered the gun and then lost it a second time. A man from the mob has come down to help him. Pitt knows the man had been sent to kill him so he tricks the man,gets the gun and drives to the airport to leave Mexico. Unfortunately,Pitt has the wrong passport and can&apos;t get on his flight. He goes back to the small town where he left the man handcuffed,but he&apos;s gone.Gandolfini and roberts meet up with Pitt and for some reason,Pitt does not tell him he has the gun but will take him to where it&apos;s hidden. Pitt has an argument with Roberts and nearly wrecks the car causing a blowout. While pitt is changing the tire,Gandolfini pulls a gun on him. Roberts is furious with Pitt and has been walking away. Pitt hasn&apos;t seen Gandolfini&apos;s gun yet but Gandolfini sees Roberts walking away and puts his gun away. He knows that Roberts loves Pitt and he just can&apos;t kill him.Gandolfini helps Pitt change the tire and now Pitt pulls a gun on Gandolfini. Gandolfini sees the gun in the reflection on the hubcap and turns to fire but Pitt shoots first and kills Gandolfini.It seems that Pitt had once met Leroy and knew that Gandolfini was not who he claimed to be. He realized that he was there to kill him. Roberts is extremely upset but Pitt and her stay together trying to decide what to do now.In their hotel room,Pitt looks out the window and see someone trying to break into his car. the same person that stole it the first time. He goes down to stop him and is punched in the face (twice) and knocked out.He is driven to a very nice ranch house and there he meets the mob boss who has been let out of prison - Gene Hackman.In prison Hackman was befriended by the grandson of the ranchowner. the son was killed saving the life of Hackman in prison. The ranch owner is the grandson of the man who made &quot;The Mexican.&quot;We are ow told the true legend of The mexican. It was made by a gunsmith as a gift to a rich noble so the nobleman&apos;s son would marry his daughter. Unfortunately,the daughter was in love with the gunsmith&apos;s assistant. On the wedding day the nobleman&apos;s son is presented with the gun and it fails to work. He notices his future bride and the assistant staring at each other. He realizes they are in love and shoots and kills the assistant. The girl picks up the gun,puts it to her head and shoots herself. The gun contained two bullets,one of which has now been used.Hackman has been trying to get the gun to give it back to the rightful owner,the great grandson. Balaban has been trying to get it to sell for profit.Roberts is back in the hotel room and has the gun tied to her leg when Balaban appears on the balcony. Roberts hides between 2 mattresses.We next see Pitt and some mexican employees of the ranchowner driving into town. Balaban is standing beside his car and asks Pitt where the gun is. Pitt says only Roberts knows and Balaban opens the trunk to reveal Roberts. unfortunately for Balaban,when he opens the trunk,Roberts has the gun pointed right at him. She shoots the 2nd and last bullet,hitting him in the throat. We hardly know he&apos;s been shot until he opens his mouth and smoke comes out.The ranchhands take the gun back to the ranch and a brass ring that had fallen off the gun is picked up by Pitt. He uses it as a wedding band and places it on Roberts finger.The final scene shows the two of them driving off - arguing...</Plot>

        <Title>The Number 23</Title>

        <Genre>Drama</Genre>

        <Plot>Introduction. The Number 23 is the story of Walter Sparrow,a man with a shattered childhood who has murdered a woman in a jealous rage,who then attempted suicide but failed,who then recovered without memory of his awful past and of the awful things he had done,and who years later reads a book that he wrote while insane (though he does not know he was the author while he reads it) that contains the key to his past and to the location of the murdered woman&apos;s body. The key is the number 23. Only he can use the key to find the truth,a truth of which he is unaware,a truth that can drive him insane once again. The film portrays his obsession with the number 23 and his gradual discovery of the truth from his contemporary perspective. To accomplish its magic,the film utilizes a multi-layered plot:Layer 1 is the current events in the life of Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey): his relationship with his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) and his son Robin (Logan Lerman),with a family friend,Isaac French (Danny Huston),and there&apos;s Ned,a black and white bulldog,and most importantly there&apos;s his obsession with the number 23;Layer 2 is the events in the book The Number 23: A Novel of Obsession by Topsy Kretts which Walter is reading - onto its characters Walter projects the people in his life: Himself as Fingerling (a police detective who is the embodiment of Walter&apos;s aspirations),himself as Isobel Lydia Hunt (a woman known as the Suicide Blonde who is the embodiment of Walter&apos;s tragedies,who witnessed suicide in her own family just as Walter witnessed suicide in his own family,who is driven crazy by the number 23 just as Walter is driven crazy by the number 23,and who subsequently commits suicide just as Walter tried to commit suicide),Agatha as Fabrizia (Fingerling&apos;s lover),and Isaac as Dr. Miles Phoenix (the police department&apos;s psychiatrist),plus a projection of his mother (Lynn Collins) as the widow Dobkins (a neighbor who committed suicide and whose body Fingerling found when he was eight years old) - in the course of the film and after a few red herrings the viewer discovers that Walter is Topsy Kretts,that the story is his forgotten past,and that he was insane when he wrote it; andLayer 3 is the actual events from Walter&apos;s past which he has suppressed,especially Walter&apos;s relationship with and murder of a college student,Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra),who once jilted him,and with Kyle Flinch (Mark Pellegrino),Laura&apos;s psychology professor and lover who was subsequently and wrongfully convicted of her murder and who,in his mind,Walter projects as Isaac. The book contains a message that discloses the location of Laura&apos;s corpse but in a form (using the number 23) that only Walter can understand.Walter&apos;s reuse of real people as his projections of the characters in the book and the piece-wise disclosure of Walter&apos;s story makes figuring out the plot of The Number 23 a challenging task.February 3. It&apos;s Walter&apos;s birthday. During the last animal control call of the day he&apos;s bitten by Ned. He chases the dog but loses it in a graveyard. He sees a gravestone bearing the name of Laura Tollins and is left with a feeling of familiarity as though he knew her (which of course he did but doesn&apos;t remember). Walter&apos;s brush with Ned causes him to be late picking up Agatha from her cake shop. While she waits for him,Agatha visits a nearby book store and buys a book,The Number 23: A Novel of Obsession by Topsy Kretts,which she gives to Walter. That night,Walter begins reading the book. Chapter 1: In its first paragraph,the book&apos;s protagonist,Fingerling,attributes his nickname to a children&apos;s book,Fingerling at the Zoo,which Walter remembers well from his own childhood.February 4. Walter is given the day off by the departmental psychologist who evaluates him following his dog bite. He uses the day to continue reading the book. Chapter 2: Fingerling recounts his childhood. His father wants him to follow in his accounting business but Fingerling wants to be a detective. On his eighth birthday he finds the lady next door dead on her bed,wrists slit. Though the coroner rules it suicide,Fingerling imagines a neighborhood stalker has taken her life. Walter says that his mother died on his eighth birthday and marvels at the coincidence. That night in bed,Walter has his first hallucination: the shadow of a man (himself) with a knife.February 5. Walter is reading the book in a park. Chapter 5: Fingerling meets the Suicide Blond. She&apos;s currently trying on a noose but she&apos;s obviously slit her wrists in the past. Fingerling talks her down from her impromptu gallows and learns her story. It is a story of the number 23 and of madness. &quot;Pink is my favorite color. Do you know what pink is? Red 27,white 65 - 65 plus 27,92 - &apos;Pink&apos; has four letters - 92 divided by four,twenty-fucking-three!&quot; After Fingerling leaves her apartment,the Suicide Blonde leaps out a window. Later,Fingerling and Fabrizia have wild sex in the Suicide Blond&apos;s apartment. It&apos;s Fabrizia&apos;s idea. At the house,Walter points out to Agatha and Robin the parallels between Fingerling and himself. He points out the 23s in his name,birth date,driver&apos;s license,Social Security number,&quot;everything!&quot; Chapter 7: Fingerling binds Fabrizia to a bed and,at her urging,pretends he has a knife at her throat. She loves it. They have more wild sex. In the middle of the night Walter sees more murderous shadows. Then he gets out of bed and counts Agatha&apos;s shoes.February 6. In the morning,Agatha covers Walter as he sleeps on the couch. He&apos;s been reading all night,finding more 23s in his life. She finds writing all over his arms and calls Isaac. When he wakes,Walter goes to visit the psychology professor. Isaac reassures Walter,&quot;This is magical thinking,non-scientific causal reasoning. Now you&apos;re... you&apos;re looking for 23 so you&apos;re finding it.&quot; Walter is unconvinced. Fingerling sees Miles in his office and the police psychologist puts him on &quot;emotional leave&quot;. Without active duty and without his gun,Fingerling is no longer sexually appealing to Fabrizia. She begins an in-plain-sight affair with Miles that humiliates Fingerling. He imagines himself murdering Miles. As he thinks about Miles,the fictional character becomes the real-life Isaac and Walter&apos;s book fantasy and his life begin to merge. He sees &quot;23&quot; everywhere as he walks the streets. When he gets to Agatha&apos;s shop and sees her talking with Isaac,his paranoia blossoms. Chapter 21: Miles has seduced Fabrizia. Fingerling stumbles across them having sex in the woods. That night Walter wakes with a start and looks at the clock. It reads 11:12. He discovers that he&apos;s stabbed Agatha in her sleep. Then he wakes with a start. He&apos;s relieved,it was just a bad dream. He looks at the clock. It reads 11:12. Shaken by dÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©ja vu,he impulsively leaves the house and drives to the King Edward Hotel for the night. He has left a note: &quot;Ag,I don&apos;t want you to be worried. I just need one night to clear my head. Please don&apos;t give up on me.&quot; He doesn&apos;t know why he&apos;s at the King Edward. He insists on room 23.February 7. In the hotel room Walter continues reading the book. Chapter 22: Fabrizia has been murdered. Miles finds her body. He absentmindedly picks up the knife. Later,he is led away in a police car as Fingerling flees the scene. Fingerling&apos;s face is spotted with Fabrizia&apos;s blood. Back at the hotel,Fingerling takes the final step into madness: he steps out onto the balcony. The book abruptly ends. Walter is perplexed. Then he hears a dog bark. It&apos;s Ned. He follows the dog to the graveyard once again,to the grave of Laura Tollins. Walter is beginning to put the pieces together. He returns home with newspaper clippings about Laura&apos;s murder and about the fate of Kyle Flinch. He&apos;s convinced that Flinch is Topsy Kretts,that the book is actually Flinch&apos;s confession.February 8. Walter confronts Flinch in prison. The man admits to having been Laura&apos;s lover but denies having killed her and denies having written the book. Walter believes him because of his apparent sincerity and because the letters of his name do not sum to 23. Robin has an idea for how to flush out Topsy Kretts. That evening,Walter sends 23 empty boxes to the post box that Robin found in the back of the book. That night in bed Agatha tells Walter,&quot;You wouldn&apos;t hurt anyone,ever.&quot; &quot;How do you know?&quot; he replies.February 9. Walter,Agatha,and Robin stake out Topsy Kretts&apos;s post box. Dr. Sirius Leary (Bud Cort) shows up to claim the boxes,but before Walter can question him,Leary slits his own throat. Leary carries a secret mystery (Walter&apos;s book) and a key to that mystery (the number 23) that he didn&apos;t know how to use and that has driven him insane. Agatha insists that Walter and Robin go home. Before he dies,Leary tells Agatha of an institute. She finds an identification card in his pocket. He was on the staff of Nathaniel&apos;s Institute,Psychiatric Care Facility. That night,after she phones home and denies to Walter that Leary said anything,Agatha goes to the now-closed and abandoned mental hospital. She finds records indicating that Walter had been a patient there and she also finds a draft of the book with Walter&apos;s name in place of &quot;Topsy Kretts&quot; just as the form of a man approaches. Meanwhile,by taking every 23rd word on every 23rd page,Walter decodes a message: &quot;Visit Casanova Spark dig beneath the steps too Heaven I warn you hell is waiting sparrow man&quot;. He leaves a note for Agatha,then he and Robin leave for the base of the Steps to Heaven - of course,there are 23 steps - located in Casanova&apos;s Park. At the park,Walter and Robin dig and uncover a skeleton. Just as they leave to fetch the cops,the sound of a mysterious person is heard approaching what must be Laura&apos;s grave. When the cops get there,her skeleton is gone. The cops dismiss Walter&apos;s and Robin&apos;s insistent assertions that a skeleton was found and is now missing. As the bewildered cops leave,Agatha and Isaac arrive.The Crisis. As Walter,Agatha,and Robin drive home,Walter sees dirt in Agatha&apos;s fingernails. It was Isaac&apos;s form that Agatha saw in the ruin of a hospital. It was Isaac and Agatha who moved Laura&apos;s skeleton. Once home Walter claims that Agatha wrote the book to make it look like he wrote it. Then he accuses Agatha and Isaac of being in conspiracy to pin him with Laura&apos;s murder. He flees.February 10. Walter returns to room 23 of the King Edward Hotel. While bolts of recollection flash through his mind,Walter tears down the crumbling wallpaper and finds the 23rd chapter beneath. Chapter 23: &quot;You can call me Fingerling,but my real name is Walter,Walter Paul Sparrow.&quot; True recollection now floods Walter&apos;s brain. Recollection of his mother&apos;s suicide followed by his father&apos;s suicide. Recollection of his foster homes and of college and Laura Tollis,all the while pursued and tortured by the number 23. Recollection of betrayal,of Laura in the woods having sex with her professor,Kyle Flinch. Recollection of her rejection when he tried to save her from the number. Recollection of killing her and burying her beneath the Steps to Heaven. Recollection of Flinch&apos;s arrest. Recollection of the King Edward Hotel,room 23,and the suicide note that turned into a book. Recollection of obsession,insanity. Recollection of leaping out of the window and of his hospitalization.Resolution. After Agatha pledges her love and loyalty over Walter&apos;s protestations that she can&apos;t love a killer,he flees the King Edward Hotel. On the street he flirts with suicide but his son&apos;s calls pull him back. Later,as he awaits sentencing for the murder of Laura Tollis,Walter contemplates that not all may be lost,that he&apos;s not the same man who wrote the book,and that he may qualify for early parole and reunion with his family.MarkFilipak-imdb</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins in England. At a local museum,a tour guide is showing a group to the Magna Carta. When they arrive,they see that the Magna Carta is missing. The only thing left is a card that says: &quot;The Tornado.&quot;In Italy,a monk is showing people where the Shroud of Turin is stored in the church,only to discover that it to has been stolen. There is a card that reads: &quot;Il Tornado (The Tornado).&quot;In Japan,the police arrive after discovering that an artifact has been stolen from a museum. Again,there is a card that reads &quot;The Tornado&quot; in Japanese.Finally,we arrive in France. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese) arrives at the office of the head of Government. The governor of France informs Inspector Dreyfus that England,Italy,and Japan are assembling a dream team of detectives to help recover the stolen treasures,but they will need help from other nations. This includes France. Inspector Dreyfus assumes that he is the detective that will represent France,but is disappointed when the Governor tells him that Clouseau has been chosen to lead the dream-team since he has been considered the greatest detective in France,after recovering the Pink Panther diamond. Dreyfus calmly gets up and steps into the bathroom. Moments later,he begins throwing a fit about Clouseau. He returns to the Governor&apos;s office and says that Clouseau cannot be assigned to the dream-team,because he already has an important job.It turns out; this &quot;important job&quot; is nothing of that sort. Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) is simply a parking officer,in charge of leaving tickets and such. When he sees that a car is parked only little ways from a parking meter,Clouseau writes up a ticket. The driver arrives and feels that the ticket isn&apos;t needed,gets in his car and tries to drive away. Clouseau won&apos;t have it and chases the car so he can hand the ticket to the driver. As he tries to stick his hand through the window,the driver rolls up the window and crushes Clouseau&apos;s hand,but Clouseau won&apos;t give up,even though the car is now dragging him. When Clouseau demands that the driver stop the car,the driver slams on the brakes and sends Clouseau flying through the air and past the Eiffel Tower.We are then treated to an animated opening credits sequence.After the opening credits,we see Inspector Dreyfus arrive at his office where a new security system has been installed to protect France&apos;s greatest artifact,The Pink Panther diamond. Inspector Dreyfus tells his assistant that Clouseau has been assigned to the Dream Team. Before the assistant can question him,Clouseau arrives. Inspector Dreyfus is clearly jealous as Clouseau shows off his medal that the Mayor of France had given him for recovering the Pink Panther. As Inspector Dreyfus is about to speak about The Dream Team,Clouseau lunges his pen at a security camera and then another,and then he cuts a hole in Inspector Dreyfus&apos; portrait and removes the recording equipment which is part of the security system. Soon,the police arrive and attack Inspector Dreyfus,thinking he is a criminal. They demand to know the password. Thankfully,Clouseau has the password and the police leave. The password was &quot;Hamdburger&quot; but Inspector Dreyfus pronounces the word &quot;Hamburger&quot; instead which results in an argument about the pronunciation of the password.After the argument,Inspector Dreyfus wonders how Clouseau knew the password. It turns out that Clouseau has a special system installed into his medal,all he has to do is type in certain things and the password is revealed. He also shows off his tape-recorder/pen. Inspector Dreyfus tells Clouseau that he has been assigned to the Dream Team,but Clouseau feels that he should stay behind because of the recent thefts and he fears that the Pink Panther will be stolen next. Inspector Dreyfus says that he is guarding the Pink Panther. Clouseau still argues with him,before Inspector Dreyfus says that he is giving him an order. Clouseau,never going against direct orders,agrees to the plan with a firm salute.Back at Clouseau&apos;s office,Clouseau is packing for the trip when his secretary,Nicole (Emily Mortimer) arrives. Nicole is disappointed when she sees Clouseau&apos;s plane tickets for Japan,and wonders when he will return. Clouseau says he doesn&apos;t know when he will return,which upsets Nicole. Clouseau says that he can&apos;t stay in contact with Nicole,and says that,for awhile,they must forget each other and that one night they had spent together. Cut to six months (or weeks) ago,Nicole and Clouseau are in Rome together at a restaurant called &quot;La Plata de Nada.&quot; It seems they are just out for dinner for business only,and don&apos;t think that any romance will happen. Clouseau leaves the table to select a wine,but only manages to send a dozen wine bottles flying all over the place,nearly hitting customers and sending the place into chaos. Things only get worse when Clouseau sets the restaurant on fire. By some twist of fate,it sparks a romance between Nicole and Clouseau. Back in the present,Nicole and Clouseau agree to forget that night and each other for the time being. They attempt to hug goodbye,but are caught off guard when Clouseau&apos;s fellow detective and friend,Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno),arrives to fetch Clouseau. When they go to the car,Clouseau says that he is ready to drive,and Ponton agrees but seems a bit skeptical.For awhile,the car ride goes well. Until,Clouseau decides to discuss his relationship with Nicole and accidentally lets go of the wheel. Leaving an extremely nervous Ponton to take control of the wheel and assure Clouseau that everything will work out. When they arrive at the airport,Ponton mentions that his anniversary with his wife is coming up and says that things haven&apos;t been going well between them. Ponton says they had argued about his work,because Ponton seems to put it before his family. Clouseau tells Ponton to not give into his wife&apos;s nagging and continue to put his work first. Ponton and Clouseau say goodbye,but just as Clouseau steps over the yellow tape,the Pink Panther is suddenly stolen.Clouseau remains in France,and the Dream Team is flown in. When Clouseau arrives at the scene of the crime,he sees Nicole but pretends not to know her,which makes Ponton wonder.Ponton and Nicole follow Clouseau where they meet the Dream Team. There is: Miles Pepperidge from England,Vincenzo from Italy and Kenji from Japan. It seems that Clouseau has a hard time pronouncing Vincenzo&apos;s full name,which makes Vincenzo a bit annoyed. It also seems that Vincenzo is smitten with Nicole.As Pepperidge begins to deduct the crime scene,Clouseau tries to outdo him,which results in an argument. Soon,the Dream Team adds another member named Sonia; she is a second-rate detective from India and very alluring. Nicole can&apos;t help but notice the attraction between Sonia and Clouseau.Later on,Vincenzo admits to Clouseau that he is attracted to Nicole,Clouseau,remembering to protect Nicole,says he isn&apos;t interested in Nicole because she is drab and disgusting. Vincenzo disagrees and walks away from Clouseau.As everyone is setting out to leave,Clouseau refers to Kenji as his &quot;little yellow friend.&quot; Kenji seems highly offended. Clouseau is sent to the team&apos;s etiquette teacher,Mrs. Berenger (Lily Tomlin). Berenger tells Clouseau that he shouldn&apos;t have called Kenji that. When Clouseau asks why,Berenger informs him that it is a stereotype. Clouseau seems to shrug it off. In an effort to break Clouseau of his stereotypical remarks,Berenger turns the conversation towards women. She asks Clouseau to pretend that she is a sensual woman with exposed cleavage,and says that Clouseau&apos;s expression during the charade must remain neutral. Berenger pretends she is picking up a pencil,but by the end of it,Clouseau looks a bit horny. Clouseau says to Berenger that he likes her.&#x0A;Click Here!At the airport,everyone arrives at Vincenzo&apos;s private jet. When the team wonders about the pilot,Vincenzo says that he is the pilot. Vincenzo says that he wants Nicole to be his co-pilot,and Nicole agrees. Aboard the jet,Clouseau watches as Vincenzo and Nicole flirt with each other. Sonia,however,has intentions of flirting with Clouseau,and tries to convince him that Nicole is most likely interested in younger men like Vincenzo. Sonia also admits to Clouseau that she is more interested in older men,like Clouseau. Nicole turns her head and sees Sonia and Clouseau getting chummy,Vincenzo speaks of what Clouseau had said to him about Nicole being drab and disgusting. Offended by Clouseau,Nicole begins to drift away from him and closer to Vincenzo.The team arrives in Rome to see one of the suspects,Alonzo Avellaneda,a blacksmith who is often associated with The Tornado. Clouseau tells Nicole that he is going to sneak around,but Nicole doesn&apos;t seem to mind him. As the Dream Team interviews Avellaneda,they can see on the security monitors that Clouseau is making a complete fool of himself. In an effort to keep Avellaneda distracted,the Dream Team keeps hitting him with questions. They even force him to remove his shirt,as the Tornado is known to have a bullet wound in his right shoulder. Pepperidge examines both of the shoulder blades,but can see no sign of the wound. Clouseau then makes his entrance by sliding down the chimney and accusing Avellaneda.Later on,Pepperidge,Vincenzo,and Kenji are outside with Clouseau and trying to convince him that Avellaneda is not The Tornado because he has no wound. Clouseau suggests that perhaps Avellaneda had plastic surgery to cover it up. Seeing no sense in arguing,the Dream Team,Clouseau,Ponton and Nicole pack up and leave the home. Avellaneda gives the all-clear,and the real Tornado steps out of a room. As the Tornado goes by the window,he says that he once knew one of the detectives but he won&apos;t say whom.Clouseau gets a tip that Avellanda and a lady-friend will be dining at La Plata De Nada that night. So,Ponton and Clouseau watch the restaurant from across the street,they have already planted a bug under Avellanda&apos;s table so they can hear the conversation. However,Clouseau is taken by surprise when he sees Nicole and Vincenzo at the restaurant together and being very friendly with one another. Fearing that Nicole is cheating,Clouseau tells Ponton that they have to move the bug over to Nicole and Vincenzo&apos;s table. Ponton wonders how they could manage that. Clouseau sees one of the dancers for the restaurants entertainment is going through the back door; he attacks him and steals his costume. Since the costume includes a mask,nobody recognizes Clouseau. While making the effort to move the bug,Clouseau&apos;s dancing causes trouble and he,once again,manages to burn down the restaurant.Once outside,after the fire,Ponton points out Nicole to Clouseau. Nicole takes one look at Clouseau,and begins to cough; Vincenzo who escorts her off the premises comforts her. Clouseau seems highly disappointed.Later in the night,The Tornado sneaks into the Papal Palace and steals the Pope&apos;s ring as he sleeps.The next morning,the Dream Team arrives at the Papal Palace and the Italian reporters question Pepperidge. After dealing with the press,the Dream Team goes to see the Pope. Vincenzo kisses the Pope&apos;s hand and assures him that he will find the ring and return it to him. The Pope tells him to have a seat,but Clouseau steals the seat. Clouseau begins to make assumptions that perhaps the Pope himself stole the ring to gain money,but the Pope denies the accusation. In order to investigate,Clouseau thinks he should place himself in the Pope&apos;s position. Literally. After dressing in the Pope&apos;s robes,Clouseau steps onto the balcony but ends up tumbling off it. Making him the center of the news.The Dream Team travel back to France but Clouseau gets an unexpected surprise when Pontons two boys,Antoine and Louis,attack him. Clouseau tries to show the boys how to do a surprise attack,by attacking a sleeping Ponton. However,Clouseau is the one taken by surprise when Ponton kicks him and sends him crashing into the coffee table. Soon after,their mother picks up Antoine and Louis,Ponton seems upset as he kisses his sons goodbye. Clouseau tries to cheer him up and tells him that he should be happy to be a bachelor again. He asks Ponton how they should celebrate singlehood. Of course,both being middle-age men,the only fun thing they are able to do is shampoo each other&apos;s hair. Clouseau reads the shampoo bottle but has a hard time pronouncing the name of the shampoo,Ponton tells him the correct pronunciation. They find the actual Shampoo brand name amusing,and make a song about it. Only seconds later does Ponton decide that he has to go back to his wife and sons. Clouseau says that work should always come first,but Ponton disagrees and says that he now realizes that love and family should come before work with no expectations. Ponton says that when you are in love,that you may not even know it,he uses Nicole and Clouseau as an example. Ponton says that he knows that Clouseau loves Nicole but refuses to see it; he says that when a man loves a woman than the man should be able to know everything about the woman. When Clouseau doesn&apos;t respond,Ponton begins to leave but Clouseau suddenly speaks about Nicole. He says that Nicole loves the smell of Vanilla and that she loves her cats Wendy and Louise (there was a third cat,but I forgot its name),he also says that Nicole is the most beautiful woman in the world but she doesn&apos;t believe it. Ponton asks Clouseau why he never tells Nicole that she is beautiful,Clouseau admits that if he tells Nicole that she is beautiful then she will leave him. Wanting to be consoled,Clouseau hugs Ponton. Unfortunately,Ponton is left with a big shampoo smudge on his cheek.At the main headquarters,Vincenzo and Kenji and Pepperidge are extremely angry about Clouseau&apos;s stunt at the Papal Palace. Sonia says that she likes Clouseau and wants to keep him on the case,but the boys disagree. With a show of hands,Clouseau is voted off the team. Clouseau arrives and raises his hand when he sees that the boys have their hands raised. Vincenzo informs Clouseau that they were just voting Clouseau off the team.Upset,Clouseau returns to his office later but finds Sonia there as well. It turns out,that Nicole has quit and Sonia was just cleaning out her things. Seeing that Clouseau is extremely vulnerable,Sonia takes advantage and says that she knows how it feels to be rejected. Clouseau peeks his head out of the office to be sure that Mrs. Berenger is nowhere to be found; afterwards he goes back to Sonia and says that she is &quot;sexy&quot; and extremely attractive. Clouseau and Sonia share a hug and Nicole walks in on them,but becomes upset and leaves. Berenger pops her head inside of the office and says that she wants to see Clouseau soon.Later on,the Dream Team is on the scene of a suicide,the Tornado&apos;s suicide. Clouseau arrives,apparently ignoring that he has been kicked off the team. The others say that he should leave because the case has been closed because of the Tornado killing himself. Clouseau wants to see the stolen artifacts and Kenji shows him the crates that are filled with the artifacts. Clouseau is worried when he can&apos;t see the Pink Panther. Pepperidge tells him that it was the only thing they couldn&apos;t recover. Clouseau tells everyone that the case won&apos;t be closed because the real Tornado hasn&apos;t been caught. Everyone tries to convince him,Sonia evens reads a suicide note written in the Tornado&apos;s hand. Clouseau says that until the Pink Panther has been recovered,then the case is still unsolved. Seeing no sense in arguing with their team member,the Dream Team attends a press conference and announces that the case is officially closed,but Clouseau makes his opinion known. Clouseau is angered when Vincenzo says that the real thief is Nicole,because she has stolen Vincenzo&apos;s heart. The press finds this romantic,but Clouseau doesn&apos;t seem amused.Later on at a banquet to celebrate the Dream Team&apos;s success,Clouseau has been placed on parking duty again. Nicole goes outside and brings Clouseau something to eat,and Clouseau thanks her. Nicole,no longer able to control her anger,confronts Clouseau about why he called her drab and disgusting. Clouseau says he was only doing it to protect her and that he really believes she is beautiful. Nicole,upset and confused,runs back inside. Sonia pulls up in her rental car and informs Clouseau that she is leaving France; Clouseau bids her farewell as Sonia steps inside to join the others. As Clouseau stands outside,he sees the license plate on the back of Sonia&apos;s rental car,and realizes the truth. He runs inside and takes Inspector Dreyfus aside and says that he knows where the Pink Panther is. The Dream Team watches from afar as they see Inspector Dreyfus arguing with Clouseau. Inspector Dreyfus returns to the table and says that Clouseau believes that the Tornado is really Sonia. The Dream Team laughs it off and,as a joke,try to figure out how Sonia could have done it. When they produce an actual theory,Nicole seems extremely suspicious. The others just think of it as a game,and don&apos;t believe Sonia is capable of stealing all those artifacts. Sonia gets up to leave but Nicole asks her to empty her purse,Vincenzo tells Nicole that it was only a game. Nicole says they should finish the game by letting Sonia empty her purse,now even the Dream Team is suspicious. Sonia pulls out a gun and holds it to Nicole; Clouseau arrives on the scene to stop Sonia.Sonia leads Pepperidge,Clouseau,Kenji,and Vincenzo on a chase through the building. They come to a hallway,Sonia pours gasoline all over the hallway and uses her gun to set the hall ablaze. The Dream Team and Clouseau manage to put out the fire,but manage to get covered with cake and flower after crashing with a few dessert trays. Sonia,in an effort to escape,shoots the Pink Panther and the sparks fly all over the building. As Sonia runs to escape,her head is dented when she bumps into a metal tray that was being held up by Ponton. Sonia is arrested,but everyone despairs because the Pink Panther has been destroyed. Clouseau calls in Antoine who is holding a case,which reveals the real Pink Panther diamond. Clouseau says that when he feared that the Pink Panther would be stolen,that he took the real Pink Panther and replaced it with a replica. Vincenzo observes Nicole and Clouseau,and realizes that he loves Nicole far too much to watch her suffer. Vincenzo tells Clouseau that Nicole loves him and that nothing happened the night that the restaurant was set on fire. Clouseau professes his love for Nicole and gets on one knee and proposes marriage.On the day of Nicole and Clouseau&apos;s wedding,the entire Dream Team (with the exception of Sonia) is present and Inspector Dreyfus is performing the ceremony. After the kiss,Clouseau tosses his pen again at a security camera and the police arrive again. They once again force Inspector Dreyfus for the password,but Clouseau&apos;s gadget has a glitch. Clouseau and Nicole rush away,and Nicole tosses her bouquet. In a surprise twist,Pepperidge catches the bouquet. The film ends as the ceremony goes into complete chaos with cake flying and machine guns going off. Suddenly,the animated Pink Panther enters the wedding room and winks at the camera. The end.</Plot>

        <Plot>Rudy Baylor (Damon) is a graduate of the University of Memphis Law School. Unlike most of his fellow grads,he has no high-paying job lined up and is forced to apply for part-time positions while serving drinks at a Memphis bar.Desperate for a job,he reluctantly is introduced to J. Lyman &quot;Bruiser&quot; Stone (Mickey Rourke),a ruthless but successful ambulance-chasing lawyer,who makes him an associate. To earn his fee,Rudy is required to hunt for potential clients at a local hospital. He meets Deck Shifflet (DeVito),a less-than-ethical former insurance assessor,now a paralegal who has failed the bar exam six times. However,Deck is resourceful in gathering information and practically an expert on insurance lawsuits.Rudy has just one case,one of insurance bad faith. It could be worth several million dollars in damages,but his personal life is falling to pieces and he is about to declare himself bankrupt. When his employer is raided by the police and the FBI,he and Deck set up a practice themselves. They file suit on behalf of a middle-aged couple,Dot and Buddy Black,whose 22-year-old son Donny Ray is dying of leukemia,but could have been saved with a bone marrow transplant,denied by their insurance carrier Great Benefit.Rudy passes the Tennessee bar exam but has never argued a case before a judge and jury. Now he finds himself up against a group of experienced and devious lawyers from a large firm,headed by Leo F. Drummond (Voight),a showman attorney who uses unscrupulous tactics to win his cases.The original judge assigned the case,Harvey Hale,is set to dismiss it because he sees it as one of many so-called &quot;lottery&quot; cases that slow down the judicial process. But a far more sympathetic judge,Tyrone Kipler (Glover),takes over when Hale suffers a fatal heart attack in his swimming pool. Kipler,a former civil rights attorney,immediately denies the insurance company&apos;s petition for dismissal.While preparing his case,Rudy seeks new clients and meets pretty Kelly Riker (Danes),a battered wife whose husband Cliff&apos;s savage beatings have put her in the hospital. He persuades Kelly to file for divorce,but this leads to a confrontation with Rudy that results in the abusive husband&apos;s death. To keep Rudy from being implicated,Kelly tells the police she was alone and killed her husband in self-defense. The district attorney declines to prosecute her.Donny Ray dies,but not before giving a video deposition in the front yard of his home. The case goes to trial,where Drummond preys on Rudy&apos;s inexperience. He gets the vital testimony of Rudy&apos;s key witness,Jackie Lemanczyk,stricken from the record. Nevertheless,thanks to Rudy&apos;s single-minded determination and skillful cross-examination of Great Benefit&apos;s unctuous president,Wilfred Keeley,the jury finds for the plaintiff.It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck,at least until the insurance company quickly declares itself bankrupt,thus allowing it to avoid paying fifty million dollars in punitive damages. There is no payout for the grieving parents and no fee for Rudy.Deciding that this triumph will create unrealistic expectations for future clients,Rudy decides to abandon his new practice after only one case to teach law with a focus on ethical behaviour instead. Furthermore,he leaves town with Kelly,out of a desire to remain low profile and protect Kelly from any possible retribution from Cliff&apos;s vengeful relatives.</Plot>

        <Plot>Father Costigan (Stephen Rea) find that his photo collection burning very selectively. When he puts them together,he finds they form a pattern of an upside down sickle,with a cross through it. This symbol is the inverted astrological symbol for Ceres (),thought to represent motherly love. When the symbol is inverted,as it is in this movie,it is believed by some to be a Satanic symbol.Meanwhile in ConcepciÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³n,Chile,Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) and assistant Ben (Idris Elba) are investigating claims of a miracle. Upon exploring the area,Katherine uncovers a cache of hazardous waste illegally stashed in an underground oil well,which has ruptured and is causing the effects of the &apos;miracle&apos;,as well as infecting the local people.When Katherine returns home to Louisiana,she receives a call from Father Costigan,who warns her that it was her face burning in his photographs and that it is a warning from God. Katherine ignores the warning. Doug (David Morrissey),a science teacher from the small town of Haven,begs Katherine&apos;s help in finding a reason for the local river turning red (1st plague),which the locals believe is a plague caused by a twelve year old girl who witnessed (and they think caused) her older brother&apos;s death. Doug says that the girl lives in an area that was abandoned by most of the townsfolk after it was hit by several hurricanes.Katherine and Ben examine the river,and send a sample of the water to a lab to be analyzed. While there Katherine meets Loren McConnell (Anna Sophia Robb). They also bear witness to dead frogs falling into the lake (2nd plague),apparently out of the high trees. That evening they encounter flies (4th plague),which ruin their dinner,and disease (5th plague) which kills off all of Jim Wakeman&apos;s (David Jensen) cows. Katherine insists that there is a scientific explanation for all these plagues.The town doesn&apos;t have a motel,so Doug invites them to spend the night at his house. That evening,the power goes out,and Katherine goes to Doug,who is outside at his wife&apos;s grave. The two exchange personal information on their histories,with Doug convincing Katherine to drink alcohol made by the locals. Katherine was once an ordained minister,and took her husband and daughter to the Sudan for missionary work. But after a year long drought,the locals sacrificed Katherine&apos;s family to God to get it to rain,leaving Katherine disillusioned. They eventually depart back to the house.In a vision,Katherine and Doug,apparently succumbing to their growing feelings for one another,have passionate sex. As they do so,Katherine sees images of Loren,and her own tragic history as well,before waking up.In the morning Katherine goes to the McConnells&apos; house alone,where she finds the cult symbol carved on the walls. She meets Loren again and has a vision with some incomplete depiction of what really happened with Loren and her brother. She also meets Loren&apos;s mother,who asks Katherine to kill her daughter,and is then attacked by a maniacal Loren. Katherine is asked to get out by Loren&apos;s mother.Meanwhile in town,Ben and Doug learn of the cult. Shortly after learning of the cult the test results return and prove that the river was in fact turned to human blood. The citizens are having to shave the heads of all their children due to a mass outbreak of lice (3rd plague) and degenerate into a mob,ready to go out and kill Loren themselves. Katherine insists that there is a scientific explanation for everything,and tries to stop the mob from killing Loren. Ben and Doug try to get the mayor to evacuate the town,but he and his staff are struck down with boils (6th plague) and so,helpless.Against her better judgment,Katherine calls Father Costigan,who explains to her that the symbol he saw was that of a satanic cult. He informs her that they sacrifice every second born in an attempt to create &quot;a perfect child&quot;,with &quot;the eyes of the Devil&quot; to bring them power. He also states that at some point,an angel,who cannot be harmed by the cult,will appear to destroy them. He insists that Loren is that &quot;perfect child&quot; in Satan&apos;s image (a rare look of a girl as the Anti-Christ) and the plagues may just be a trick of Satan to protect that child. He also tries to convince Katherine that she is the angel sent forth by God to destroy this cult,and hence she has to kill Loren. As he tells Katherine all this,a supernatural force begins to burn everything in Costigan&apos;s room,trapping him inside and killing him.Desperate to find logical answers,Katherine goes to the McConnell house alone,where she finds the sacrificial chamber and cult symbols in a basement. She sees Loren&apos;s mother,who tells Katherine that &quot;he controls her [Loren] now&quot;,then Loren&apos;s mother kills herself. Loren finds Katherine,but is distracted by the arrival of the townsfolk.The sheriff and angry people of town gather around the McConnell house,preparing to attack and kill Loren,but suddenly thousands of locusts come to the area (8th plague). The locusts appear to be under Loren&apos;s control,and they swarm Small,his son and the sheriff,and kill them. The signs are getting harder to ignore,and Katherine begins to believe that the plagues do have a supernatural cause,and that she should kill Loren. Ben and Doug run away from the locusts,and Katherine locks herself inside the house to escape them. Ben hides in a crypt,and calls Katherine to say that he&apos;s trapped,since Loren is outside. Katherine hurries after him,knowing that she is the only one Loren trusts.When she arrives and finds Ben dead,she confronts Loren. Darkness falls (9th plague) and fireballs shoot from the sky (7th plague). Katherine overpowers Loren and is about to kill her when they share a bit of a vision,which shows Maddie and Brody McConnell holding someone&apos;s arms down. Loren says she&apos;s lucky that God sent Katherine to her. They have a longer vision,of the cult trying to kill Loren,who was a second-born child. Loren escaped and her brother Brody stabbed her,but her wound miraculously instantly healed,and Brody died. Katherine realizes that Loren is innocent,that she didn&apos;t murder her brother,that the townsfolk are the evil ones,and that she has to protect Loren from them,rather than help them kill her. She realizes that Loren is the angel that God sent.The townsfolk surround the two of them,and Doug tries to get Katherine to kill Loren. God is protecting Loren from the townsfolk,and only an ordained servant of God like Katherine can kill her. The townsfolk turned their back on God years ago after their town was hit by several hurricanes,and they invited Katherine to investigate the miracles because they hoped she would join them,since she had also turned her back on God after her family was killed. But Katherine remains on Loren&apos;s side,in part because she associates Loren with her own daughter,who was sacrificed to the Sudanese in a similar way to how these townsfolk are trying to sacrifice Loren. She also realizes that Doug was the one who killed Ben,and that he framed Loren to try to get Katherine to kill her.Katherine reminds them that because they had sacrificed generations of second-borns,the town was comprised exclusively of first-borns. At this stage,the fire begins raining down on the townsfolk,killing them (10th plague). Doug holds a knife to Katherine&apos;s throat,telling her that if Loren is not killed,she will die too. Katherine tells Loren that she shouldn&apos;t be afraid,because this is God&apos;s will. This proves that Katherine finally believes again. Doug tries to use Katherine as a shield,but Loren manipulates the fire to destroy Doug,while sparing Katherine.The movie ends with Katherine and Loren driving away together. Katherine says that they will be a family and it will be just the two of them. Loren,with her own abilities,tells Katherine it will be three: her,Katherine and the baby she is carrying. Katherine is pregnant with Doug&apos;s son,the knowledge of which causes Katherine to remember when she envisioned herself with Doug that night: Doug,as part of the community&apos;s attempts to create a demon baby,gave Katherine alcohol spiked with an intoxicant. After drinking it and becoming near-comatose,Doug proceeded to strip and rape her,and remove all evidence before she woke up the next day with no memory. Katherine fears her son may be the prophesied demonic child.</Plot>

        <Plot>The movie opens in a flash back where we see the Man (Viggo Mortensen) in bed with his wife (Charlize Theron). The man wakes up to a sound and a glow coming from outside the window of their room. He walks to the window and looks out. In a hurry,he then runs into the bathroom where he begins to fill the sink and bathtub. His wife wakes up and comes into the bathroom and asks why he is taking a shower. He says,Im not taking a shower. She then looks outside to see what he saw. The scene then cuts to the present where the man is walking with his son down a snow-covered road.As the Man and his son are walking,we hear a narration by the Man explaining that he does not keep track of time anymore. He further explains (in a very vague way) that a few years ago at 1:17,there was a bright flash in the sky followed by rumbling sounds and that was when time stopped. As the Man and his son walk and search abandoned cars,the narration continues. He then says that the sun has not come out for a long time; the weather is getting colder and greyer every day. He then says the things he fears the most are cannibals and hunger. They are walking to the coast and heading south to see if things are warmer and better there.The Man and his son stop at a car in the road and make camp. While they sit in the car talking,we see that the Man has a pistol with 2 rounds in it and a shopping cart full of things they have collected. The two talk about the boys mother and we understand that she has died. The Man also explains to the son how to kill himself the right way with the gun,and the reason there are 2 bullets left are for one for each of them. The 2 fall asleep and the Man has a dream/flashback. In this flashback,we see the Man and his wife talking about killing themselves like the other families in the area. She says that if they are caught,they will be raped,killed and eaten. He says that she needs to be strong and stop talking about that. She says that they only have 2 bullets left and that they should use them now. The Man gets up to go to the kitchen in anger/sadness. The wife then looks down and we see that her water has broken and she is pregnant. She then starts to lose control and wants to kill herself before she has the child because she does not want to raise a child in this world. The Man talks her out of it and we see him helping her through labor. Right then the flashback ends as the man wakes up suddenly to the sound of a truck in the distance. He wakes his son and they run out of the truck they were sleeping in into the nearby woods,leaving the cart. They jump and hide in a ditch and leave the cart by the truck they were sleeping in. Through a nearby tunnel,a truck full of men drives down the road and stops by the Mans cart. The men get off of the truck and start looking through the nearby woods for them. One stranger walks very close to the hiding Man and his son,and stops to urinate on a tree. He then sees the man and the son hiding and tells them to come to the truck because they have food. The Man is pointing the gun at the stranger and tells him to not look back at the people he came with and to come with them or he would shoot him in the head. He refuses and calls the Man a coward. Just then the truck starts and startles the Man and his son. The stranger then jumps down and grabs the son at knifepoint. The Man then shoots the stranger in the head,grabs his son and runs into the woods hiding over night avoiding the group who were looking for them.The next morning,the Man and his son go back for the cart. Almost all of their stuff is gone,and as they are cleaning up the little that is left,we see a bloody pile of flesh on the ground and we get the idea that the men ate the stranger who was just shot. The Man and his son continue to walk. They stop and talk about different things. The son asks if they are still the good guys. The Man explains that they are always going to be the good guys,and they are carrying the fire inside together.They stop at another truck to sleep,which is parked on top of a very high bridge. The Man and his son go to sleep. In the morning,the Man wakes up and walks to the edge of the bridge where he takes a wallet out of his jacket with a picture of his wife in it. He throws it over the bridge. We then get another flashback of the Man and his wife together with the son who is older now (almost as old as he is in the present). The wife says she is going to leave and the man begs her to stay another night. She blames the man for not letting her die earlier,refuses and walks outside without saying goodbye to the son. She takes off her jacket and outer clothing and walks off into the dark to die. The flashback is over and the Man is still at the edge of the bridge. He takes off his wedding ring and slides it to the edge of the bridge without pushing it over the side,and leaves it.The two walk on and see a large house in the distance. After looking at it through binoculars,they decide to go into the home. In the main room,there is a pile of shoes about 5 feet high. The Man is very confused and goes into the kitchen where he sees a large door in the floor,which is locked. He pries the lock open and the two go down into the dark room. They hear something in the darkness and when they get close,a naked man comes into the light. The Man and she son get scared and try to leave. As they attempt to leave,the see an entire group of malnourished people sitting scared and naked in the dark. They franticly try to leave as another naked man grabs the Man and he has to fight them off. They get out of the cellar and push a table over the door. The son screams and out the window,we see another group of people walking to the home with weapons. We also see large vats with metal bloody hooks over them and we can tell that they are used for eating the people in the locked cellar. The Man and his son run upstairs and hide in a bathroom. The Man hears a woman say she is going upstairs to change. The Man gets his gun and puts it to his sons head and gets ready to shoot him to protect him from the cannibals downstairs. As the woman makes her way upstairs,the naked people in the cellar break the door open and a large commotion breaks out. In the commotion,the Man and his son run out and quickly hide while the people in the home try to find them. They stay for a while and in the middle of the night they leave.As they are walking,they find the neighborhood where the Man grew up and his old home. He walks through the home remembering the things of his past. The son wants to wait outside. While he is sitting on the porch,the son sees a boy in a room across the street. He runs to see them and starts chasing a boy about his age. The Man then comes running after him and will not let him go any further. The Man says he imagined the boy and they leave.They come across another home on the road. They go through the home and see a man who died in his bed. They take a blanket and walk about. In the yard of this home is a pile of rubble. They look through the rubble and find a steel hatch which the Man pries open. They go into the hatch,which turns out,to be a bomb shelter stocked full of food. They eat; get a shave,the shower and make home in the new shelter. After 2 nights in the shelter,the Man wakes up coughing up some blood. They hear something from above the shelter and they both say it is a dog. The Man says they must leave because with a dog is people. They stock up food in a pull cart and head out the next morning.As they are walking,they see an old man (Robert Duvall) walking. They approach him very carefully and see that he is no threat. The boy wants to bring him along and the Man says no,but he allows the old man to eat dinner with them. As they eat and talk,the old man says that he thought the boy was an angel and he never thought he would see a child again. They continue to talk and then go to sleep. The next day the Man and the son are on their way alone again.While the Man and the son continue,they go into the woods and leave the cart because they see a series of wooden huts. As they walk closer,the Man sees a row of sticks in the ground with human skulls on them surrounded by piles of skulls on the ground. They turn to go away and they see a fresh pile of blood soaked snow and they both get scared. As they turn to run away,they see a woman and a child running as fast as they can from the woods across from them. Behind the woman is a group of cannibals chasing the woman and child. The Man and the son run into the opposite woods and in the background,we hear the woman and child get killed. The Man and the son run through the dead trees,when all of a sudden the trees around them start to fall down in a small earthquake. Multiple trees almost hit them and they take cover and hide for a minute and regroup. They check to see if it is clear and they escape to the road again.The next day after they Man and son wake up from camp,we see the Man is growing sicker. They talk about how they are close to the ocean. The son asks if the ocean is blue and the man says,It used to be. They walk up a large sand dune and look at the brown ocean and beach,which is scattered with garbage and debris. They walk to the water and look at a crashed boat about 200 yards into the surf. The Man notices that the son is getting sick. They make a small tent and the Man says he is going to the boat to see if there is anything useful there,takes off his clothes and swims out to the boat. The son falls asleep. While the son is sleeping,we see a stranger with a knife walk up to the sleeping boy in the tent. The next shot is of the Man swimming back to shore with a flare gun from the boat. He puts on his clothes and goes running to his son. They have been totally robbed,but the son is not harmed. The thief took everything including the Mans shoes. They start walking to try to catch the thief and get their belongings back.As the Man carries his son,they see the thief with their cart in the distance. The Man takes the pistol and runs after the thief. He stops the thief who is holding only a knife. The Man instructs the thief to put the knife down. He does. The Man then tells him to take off all of this clothing and to put it in the cart. The thief is terrified and does everything he asks. The man puts his shoes back on and leaves the thief naked in the road. The son begs to leave him some clothing and the man says no. They go back to the beach where the son convinces the Man to leave the thief his clothing. They go back and try to find the thief who is nowhere to be seen. They leave him his clothing and a can of food in the road. The Man and his son continue walking.They start walking through a street lined with homes. It is quiet and they find a tin with a live bug inside. While it flies away,they both stare at it in amazement. Right then the Man gets shot in the leg with an arrow. They jump to take cover and the Man shoots another stranger in a window with the flare gun. We hear screaming from the room and the wounded Man goes running to see who is inside. He gets in the room where he sees a woman who is sitting over the stranger who shot him. The stranger has just been shot and killed by the flare gun. This stranger is dead and the woman is weeping. The Man leaves the woman and gets his son and belongings. They go get shelter and the Man takes the arrow out of his leg and uses a stapler to close the wound in his leg.The Man and his son go walking back to the ocean and the man stops. He says he cannot pull the cart anymore due to his leg. They take a bag full of the food and they head to a sandy spot of the beach. The Man who is wounded and very sick lies down and they make a camp there. They fall asleep. While they are sleeping,the Man has a dream of his wife and his old life. The sun is shining,they make love and we see what life was like prior to the world ending. He wakes up to his son who is talking to him. The Man knows he is going to die soon,and he tells his son to continue on south. He says to remember things that he has taught him and to keep going like they have been. The son says he wants to die with the Man,and the Man says he cannot do it. He says that his whole heart is in his son and he has to go on. He then falls asleep and dies.The son wakes up the next morning and sees that the Man has died. He cries and lays next to him for an entire day and night.The following morning,the son wakes up. Looks at the Man,reaches into his jacket and takes his binoculars. He then covers the Man with a blanket,puts the pistol with 1 round left into his belt and he walk to the shoreline. In the distance,we see a stranger (Guy Pierce) walking toward the son. The son points the gun at him and is very scared. The stranger has a rifle but he is not aiming it at the son. The son asks him if he is a cannibal and the stranger says no. The son lowers the gun and the stranger kneels to talk to the son. The stranger asks the son who the man on the beach is and the son explains that it was his father. The stranger tells the son you have 2 choices. You can come with us or you can stay here. If you decide to stay,you should stay off the road. The son asks if he has any children. The stranger says that &quot;they have a boy with him and a girl&quot;. The son asks the stranger if he is a good guy and if he is carrying the fire inside. The stranger says that he is a good guy and says that the boy is a little freaked out. The boy asks how he can trust the stranger and the stranger says,you cant,you just have to trust me. The son then walks to his dead father and says I will do everything you taught me to do. He kissed him and covers him back up. As the son walks to the stranger,we see that he is with a woman (Molly Parker) and 2 children. The woman touches the son&apos;s face and says,we have been following you and your father for a long time. The boy sees that they also have a dog. She then continues to say,You have nothing to worry about anymore. We are with you now. We are together. As she touches his face,a tear rolls down her cheek and the screen goes black.</Plot>

        <Plot>In October 2003,Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg has the idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female Harvard undergraduates after his girlfriend Erica Albright breaks up with him. Over the course of a single night,Mark hacks into the databases of various residence halls,downloads pictures and names of female students and,using an algorithm for ranking chess players supplied by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (essentially the Elo rating system,written on a window pane recalling a scene of A beautiful mind),he creates in a few hours a website called &quot;FaceMash.com&quot;,where male students can interactively choose which of two girls presented at a time is more attractive.Mark is punished with six months of academic probation after the traffic to the site brings down parts of Harvard&apos;s computer network,and he becomes vilified among most of Harvard&apos;s female community. However,the popularity of &quot;FaceMash&quot; and the fact that he created it in one night,while drunk,brings him to the attention of Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss,identical twins and members of Harvard&apos;s rowing team,and their business partner Divya Narendra. As a result,he gains a job working for the Winklevoss twins as the programmer of their website,Harvard Connection.Soon afterwards,Mark approaches his friend Eduardo and tells him of his idea for what he calls &quot;Thefacebook&quot;,an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. He explains this would let people share personal and social information securely. Eduardo agrees to help Mark,providing a fee of $1,000 to help start the site. Once complete,they distribute the link to Eduardo&apos;s connections at the Phoenix S-K final club,and it quickly becomes popular throughout the student body. When they learn of Thefacebook,the Winklevoss twins and Narendar believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea while simultaneously stalling on their website. Cameron and Divya want to sue Mark for intellectual property theft,but Tyler convinces them they can settle the matter as &quot;Harvard gentlemen&quot; without resorting to the courts.A few months later,at a lecture by Bill Gates,fellow Harvard University student Christy Lee introduces herself and her friend Alice to Eduardo and Mark. She asks that the boys &quot;Facebook us&quot;,which impresses both of them. The girls invite them to a bar,where they have sex in the toilet. Mark later runs into his ex-girlfriend,Erica,who is not aware of The Facebook&apos;s existence because she is not a Harvard University student. Stung by this,Mark decides to expand the site to more schools. Christy,Mark,and Eduardo later return to Mark&apos;s room where they outline the structure of the company and their plan for moving forward.By the spring of 2004,the Facebook grows in popularity,and it expands to other schools in the Northeastern United States,while the Winklevoss twins and Narendra become angrier at seeing &quot;their idea&quot; advance without them. Tyler refuses to sue them,instead accusing Mark of violating the Harvard student Code of Conduct. Through their father&apos;s connections they arrange a meeting with Harvard President Larry Summers,who is dismissive and sees no potential value in either a disciplinary action or in a lawsuit against Thefacebook website itself.Through Christy Lee,now Eduardo&apos;s girlfriend,Eduardo and Mark arrange a meeting with Napster co-founder Sean Parker. When Christy,Mark and Eduardo meet Parker at a trendy Fusion restaruant in New York City,Eduardo becomes skeptical of the eccentric Parker,noting his problematic personal and professional history. Mark,however,is impressed with Parker since he presented a similar vision of Facebook. Although no deals are reached,Parker suggests that they drop &quot;The&quot; from Thefacebook to make it simply &quot;Facebook&quot;.That summer,Mark moves the company&apos;s base of operation to Palo Alto,California at Parker&apos;s suggestion,while Eduardo remains in New York for seeking advertising support. When Eduardo visits from New York,he is angered to find that Parker is living at the house and making business decisions for Facebook. After an argument with Mark,the vindictive Eduardo freezes the company&apos;s bank account and returns to New York. Upon returning,Christy and Eduardo argue about his Facebook profile,which still lists him as &quot;single&quot;. Christy accuses Eduardo of cheating on her and sets fire to a scarf he gave to her as a gift. While Eduardo extinguishes the fire,Mark angrily calls him on the phone about freezing the Facebook bank accounts,and reveals that they have secured money from &quot;an angel investor&quot; through Parker&apos;s contacts. As a result of Christy&apos;s jealousy,Eduardo ends his relationship with her.Meanwhile in England,while competing in the Henley Royal Regatta,the Winklevoss twins become outraged that Facebook has expanded to a number of universities there and they finally decide to sue Mark. Eduardo has also discovered the deal he signed with Parker&apos;s investors allows them to dilute his share of the company from a third to less than one tenth of one percent,while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts his erstwhile friend Mark at his new Facebook office in downtown L.A. and announces his intention to sue him.Later that night,Parker,along with a number of Facebook interns,is arrested for possession of cocaine during a party thrown on the occasion of Facebook&apos;s 1 millionth member. It is strongly implied (but never fully explained) that Mark had anonymously tipped off the police to raid the frat house where the party was held and probably had someone plant drugs at the party to intentionally have Parker and his interns arrested to remove them from the Facebook company.The framing device throughout the film shows Mark testifying in depositions in two lawsuits: one filed by the Winklevoss twins,and the other filed by Eduardo.In the final scene,a junior lawyer for the defense informs Mark they will be settling with Eduardo,since the sordid details of Facebook&apos;s founding and Mark&apos;s cynical personality will make a jury highly unsympathetic to him. The film ends with Mark sending a friend request to his former girlfriend Erica on Facebook,and refreshing the page every few seconds waiting for a response that never comes.</Plot>

        <Plot>Over an apocalyptic battlefield dominated by robotic war machines,some like tanks,others are hovercrafts,a title card tells us that in the future,humans will wage a long war against an enemy known as the Machines. The &quot;final battle&quot; however,will not be fought in this future world,but in the past,specifically our present.The year switches to 1984. Lighting emanates from above a garbage truck,knocking out power. The driver sees an object ahead of him and flees as the electrical surge dissipates. The object is a man (Arnold Schwarzenegger),naked and heavily muscular,and he stands up and starts walking toward the city where he is spotted by three young punks. The man orders the men to give him their clothes,and the punks produce knives in response. The giant swats two punks aside,the third stabs him,but the giant tears open the punk&apos;s body and kills him,taking his clothes.In a downtown alley,a homeless man sees a bright light just above the ground. A scarred,naked man,muscular but much smaller in size than the other man who arrived in a similar fashion,is forced through the portal and lands in the alley,in obvious pain. The naked man takes the homeless man&apos;s clothes,just as a police car pulls up and two cops yell at him to freeze. The man is able to hide and attacks one of the cops,taking his pistol. The cop becomes puzzled by the man&apos;s question of the date and year. When the cop&apos;s partner arrives,the man runs into a department store. He steals several items,including a pair of Nike sneakers and a long coat and escapes the store. In another alley outside,he steals a shotgun from an unoccupied squad car. Finding a phone book nearby,he looks up the name &quot;Sarah Connor.&quot;Elsewhere a young woman,Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton),lives the life of a lonely waitress. Sharing an apartment with her friend Ginger,Sarah is living out a boring life that seems to go nowhere.The Terminator steals a car and goes to a local sporting goods store where he has the owner show him several assault weapons and a pistol with laser sighting. The Terminator asks for a &quot;phased-plasma rifle&quot;; the owner tells him &quot;only what you see,pal&quot;. The owner tells his customer that he can take the rifles right away but the pistol has a waiting period. As he explains the process,the Terminator loads the shotgun and shoots the man. Shortly after,The Terminator finds a phone book and looks for the name &quot;Sarah Connor&quot; finding three listings in the Los Angeles area. He goes to the address of the first listing; as he walks to the front door,a small dog barks at him. When Sarah Connor opens the door,the terminator forces its way inside and brutally murders her with the pistol it acquired. Not long after,Sarah&apos;s coworker drags her to the television where Sarah sees that a woman sharing her name has been murdered by an unidentified assailant.Sarah and her roommate,Ginger,prepare for separate dates. Ginger&apos;s boyfriend,Matt,will be coming over to spend the night. Sarah gets a message from her date,who cancels. Sarah decides to go out for pizza and sees a news report where the police announce the death another woman sharing her name. Sarah becomes worried,and when she sees she is being followed (by the young man who evaded the police),she ducks into a small dance club called Tech Noir. She tries to call Ginger,however Ginger and Matt do not hear the phone while having sex. Not long after Sarah&apos;s call,Matt and Ginger are both attacked by the Terminator,who shoots both of them dead before hearing Sarah&apos;s voice on a message machine saying where she is. Sarah then phones the police department and is connected to Lt. Traxler,the detective investigating the Sarah Connor killings. He tells Sarah to stay put until he can get a squad car to her. The Terminator arrives at the club,dispatches a bouncer,and works his way inside.In the meantime,the second man who arrived via the electrical storm,Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn),a soldier from the future sent back in time to intercept the Terminator before it can kill Sarah. Sarah is spotted in the club by the Terminator,which aims its laser sighted pistol at her. Reese fires on the Terminator,hitting it with several blasts and knocking it to the floor. He tells Sarah &quot;Come with me if you wanna live&quot; and Sarah sees the man Reese shot impossibly rise to its feet. Reese and Sarah escape through the back door of the club,with the Terminator chasing them. Reese blasts the gas tank of a nearby car with explodes. The Terminator is unfazed,and jumps on the hood of Reese&apos;s car,smashing through the windshield and grasping at Sarah. Reese maneuvers his car and throws the Terminator off. Reese speeds off while the Terminator subdues a cop (screenwriter William Wisher) and takes his car.During the chase,Kyle explains that Sarah is destined to give birth to the humans&apos; future leader John Connor. Reese further explains that a nuclear war was initiated by a new,powerful computer system (referred to as &quot;Skynet&quot; in the first sequel) that was tasked with controlling all defense systems. Reese himself did not see the ensuing nuclear holocaust but grew up destitute and starving in the ruins. He was enslaved and marked with a barcode and was forced to work loading bodies into incinerators. The human race,he says,was on the verge of extinction when Sarah&apos;s son,John,was able to organize the remaining humans into an effective resistance movement that,by the time Reese was sent back to the present day by Connor himself,had defeated Skynet. In desperation,Skynet sent the Terminator to the present day to murder Sarah and eliminate John Connor&apos;s existence. Reese also explains that the Terminator pursuing Sarah,is a new model,one that appears infinitely more human than it&apos;s predecessors. Reese tells her the cyborg will bleed,sweat and even has bad breath to enhance the disguise. Reese is uncertain that he can defeat the cyborg without having the advanced weaponry of the future.While hiding out in a parking garage,Reese gets rid of his first car and steals a second one. The Terminator finds them there and the chase resumes. Reese has Sarah take over driving and is able to hit the Terminator with a few blasts from his shotgun. Sarah stops their car and the Terminator crashes into a wall. When she and Reese are arrested,she sees that the Terminator has escaped the scene.At Traxler&apos;s police precinct,Sarah is told that Ginger is dead and that Reese has been given to a psychiatrist,Peter Silberman. His story about the Terminator is treated as the babbling of a psychopath. While watching the videotape of the interview,Silberman eagerly says that a case like Reese&apos;s could be career-making. During the interview,Silberman asks Reese why he didn&apos;t bring weaponry from the future with him,to which Reese replies that only living material will go through the time portal. Reese quickly becomes agitated and begins to scream into the camera that the Terminator must be destroyed or it will not stop until it kills Sarah.The Terminator goes back to a shoddy hotel room where it hides out. It removes one of it&apos;s eyes that had been damaged when it was shot by Reese. Under the eye is a sophisticated robotic eye that glows red. It dons a set of sunglasses and marches out to resume the hunt for Sarah,taking a SPAS shotgun and an AR-15 rifle.At the police precinct,the Terminator arrives in the foyer and asks to see Sarah. The desk sergeant refuses to let the Terminator in. The Terminator goes outside and roars back in,crashing a car into the desk. It marches through the precinct ruthlessly slaughtering every officer it finds. In the battle,Traxler is killed and Reese escapes confinement. He finds Sarah and the two escape the precinct. Realizing Kyle&apos;s story is true,Sarah is told about the future where humans barely survive amid the wreckage of cities and the predations of the Terminators. She lapses into sleep and has a nightmare of a firefight where Terminators break into a human sanctuary and massacre scores of civilians. Kyle himself is there; after finding a place to rest after a Resistance patrol,he takes out a Polaroid photo of Sarah and admires it. Alerted by dogs (who can sense a Terminator) at the entrance to the bunker,Reese joins the valiant fight to a Terminator that has gotten in. The Terminator,carrying a heavy plasma gun,slaughters everyone and causes an explosion that cripples Reese. Reese sees the picture of Sarah being burned nearby.Later the two reach a roadside motel,where Kyle goes to purchase chemicals needed to make explosives. While he is shopping (using &quot;borrowed&quot; money) Sarah showers and phones her mother,telling her the phone number where she is - unaware that her &quot;mother&quot; is actually the Terminator recreating the voice of her real - and now dead - mother.The two make a stockpile of explosives and wait. When Sarah asks Kyle if he has ever had a lover,he replies he has not,a fact that touches Sarah. Kyle then mentions having a photo of Sarah and how he has fallen in love with her. Realizing he has gone too far,he furiously begins loading explosives,but Sarah stops him and kisses him. The two lose their inhibition and make love. Their consummation results in the conception of Sarah&apos;s (and Kyle&apos;s) son,John.The Terminator tracks them to the hotel and the two flee again in a stolen pickup truck. Reese makes a valiant effort to destroy the Terminator with the pipe bombs he and Sarah made,however,he is hit by gunfire and Sarah loses control of their truck,flipping it over. The Terminator recovers and is immediately struck by a semi-tanker truck. After the driver stops,the Terminator kills him and takes control of the truck,attempting to run down Sarah. Near a factory,Kyle uses his last pipe bomb to detonate the truck&apos;s tank trailer,which explodes. As Reese and Sarah embrace,the Terminator emerges from the wreckage,it&apos;s flesh completely burned off. Reese and Sarah retreat into the factory,which is automated. Reese switches on as many of the machines as he can,making tracking more difficult for the Terminator. They are finally cornered and Reese places his last bomb in the endoskeleton of the Terminator,which explodes,scattering pieces of the cyborg. Sarah,nursing a severely injured leg,finds Reese,but he&apos;s dead.She is suddenly attacked by the top half of the Terminator&apos;s skeleton. She desperately crawls away,finally luring the Terminator into a giant hydraulic press. She traps it there and,as it mindlessly tries to break her neck,pushes the button activating the press. The Terminator is crushed until it&apos;s red glowing eye fades.Sarah is taken to an ambulance and sees the paramedics put Kyle into a body bag. Later,she is driving a Jeep in the desert,seemingly towards Mexico,stopping at a gas station. She has been recording using a cassette player; the tapes are for her son. One of the questions she poses is whether or not she should tell John about Reese being his father and if that will affect his decision to send the warrior back in time to meet and save Sarah. While the Jeep&apos;s tank is filled,a young boy takes her picture with a Polaroid camera (it is the same picture Reese admires in Sarah&apos;s dream of his future). She and the boy bargain over the price and she buys it. The boy says something Spanish and the gas station owner tells her he said &quot;A storm&apos;s coming!&quot; Sarah sees the storm approaching and says &quot;I know.&quot; She drives off into an unknown future.</Plot>

        <Plot>Anna (Emily Browning) has been in a psychiatric institution for ten months,following her suicide attempt after her terminally-ill mother died in a boathouse fire. Now she is being discharged and has no memory of the fire,only dreams about it that involve three strange children. While packing,Anna is startled by a talkative patient. She is finally able to leave with her father,Steven (David Strathairn).&#x0A;At home,Anna reunites with her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel). The sisters are very close,and they are united against Steven&apos;s girlfriend Rachel (Elizabeth Banks),who was their mother&apos;s live-in nurse. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls&apos; mother was still alive,but he ignores her. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that their mother is sending a message: the fire was murder,and Rachel is the killer.&#x0A;Anna sees her old boyfriend Matt (Jesse Moss) and kisses him. He tells her that he saw everything at the fire and the two secretly plan to meet,but he doesn&apos;t show up. Later,she awakens from another dream to find him climbing into her window. He says she needs to know the truth; he had a warning from her mother. His body warps,his back breaking. Anna runs from the room and suddenly it is morning and Matt&apos;s dead body is pulled out of the water,his back broken just the way Anna saw it.&#x0A;The sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the State Nursing Association. Finally they learn she is actually Mildred Kemp,a nanny who killed the three children from Anna&apos;s dreams because she was obsessed with their widowed father. They try to warn Steven but he gets upset and leaves for work. The girls try to gather evidence but they are confronted by Rachel who drugs Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the police. Skeptical,they call Rachel to sedate Anna and drive her home.&#x0A;Rachel carries Anna to bed. Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife and passes out. Later,Anna wakes and finds a large blood trail leading to the dumpster and Rachel&apos;s body inside. Alex is nearby with the knife. The girls comfort each other,and Steven comes home. Anna explains that Rachel attacked them and Alex saved her. Confused,Steven says that Alex died in the fire. Anna sees she&apos;s not holding Alex&apos;s hand like she thought,but the bloody knife.&#x0A;Anna finally remembers the fire. After catching her father and Rachel together,Anna filled a watering can from a large gasoline tank in the boathouse and carried it toward the house,intending to burn it down. She left a trail that ignited when a candle fell over; Alex and her mother were killed in the resulting explosion. She remembers meeting Matt as planned and killing him. Flashbacks reveal that whenever it appeared as if the two sisters were together,Anna had always been alone. Anna realizes that Steven was not ignoring Alex earlier; her sister was never there. She sees that she had the knife used to kill Rachel all along.&#x0A;Steven tells the police that Rachel changed her name because of an abusive boyfriend as Anna is arrested and taken back to the institution. The police ask why Anna would make up the Mildred story but Steven has no answers. Anna is welcomed back by the patient that scared her earlier; the name plate on the door says &quot;Mildred Kemp&quot;.</Plot>

        <Plot>In 1891,Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) writes to Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) to tell him that his brother,Ben,has disappeared. Lawrence,a renowned Shakespearean actor,is touring London and races to the family&apos;s estate in Blackmoor. He has been estranged from his family for many years,since his father,Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) sent him to an insane asylum after witnessing his mother&apos;s mysterious death. When Lawrence arrives,Talbot Hall is in disrepair. John tells him that Ben&apos;s mauled body had been found the day before.Lawrence goes into town to see the body,which is kept at the local slaughterhouse. The butcher gives Ben&apos;s personal effects to Lawrence. Later,in the local tavern,Lawrence overhears the locals debate about who was responsible. Many blame a band of gypsies who are camped outside of town. Another claims that several decades earlier a similar murder had happened and that his father suspected a werewolf. Among Ben&apos;s belongings was a medallion that had been purchased from the gypsies.After Gwen leaves for London,Lawrence goes to the gypsy camp on the night of a full moon. Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin) tells him that something evil had befallen his brother. The local townspeople descend on the camp to force them to turn over a dancing bear that might have been the killer. But a superhumanly strong wolf-like creature descends on the camp,slaughtering many people. Lawrence sees a young boy run into the woods. Intending to rescue him,Lawrence follows but is attacked by the creature,who bites him on the shoulder before being chased off by the armed townspeople. Maleva sutures his wounds. Her daughter says Lawrence should be killed,but Maleva refuses,saying he is still a man. Only a loved one can kill him.Gwen returns toTalbot Hall to nurse Lawrence back to health. He has several fearful dreams but after a few weeks appears to have completely healed. John&apos;s faithful manservant,Singh (Art Malik) shows Lawrence the silver bullets he has and implies that something monstrous is on the loose in Blackmoor. Inspector Abberline (Hugo Weaving) arrives from London to investigate the recent murders. He suspects Lawrence because of his past mental issues and masterful portrayals of mentally ill protagonists like Hamlet and Macbeth. Worried about what might happen,Lawrence sends Gwen away again. He then follows to John to Lady Talbot&apos;s crypt. He finds his father in the catacombs beneath the crypt,in a shrine to the dead mother -- a shrine that includes a chair specially fitted with restraints. John tells Lawrence that he has been dead for years,then locks himself in the room alone. As Lawrence tries to leave,he turns into the Wolf Man. Rampaging through the woods,he kills several townspeople who had created a trap in hopes of catching the monster. The next day,John leads Abberline and the local police to where a dazed,bloody human Lawrence is hiding.Lawrence is taken to the same asylum in London where he was incaracerated as a child. Dr. Hoenneger (Anthony Sher) subjects him to ice-water and electrotherapy treatments. John visits Lawrence to explain the curse hanging over the family. Many years before,John had been hunting in India. Intrigued by reports of an unusual predator living in a remote cave,John traveled to a remote area. In the cave,he was bitten by a feral boy and infected with lycanthropy. Lawrence realizes that he had seen his father as a werewolf kill their mother. John had relied on Singh to imprison him during full moons. John escaped the month before and killed Ben and attacked the gypsy camp. Now invigorated by the power of being a werewolf,John has no intention of restraining his power anymore. He leaves Lawrence in the asylum.Dr. Hoenneger takes Lawrence to an observation room to present him to his colleagues as an interesting test case. As the full moon streams through the window,Lawrence transforms into the Wolf Man in front of the doctors. He kills Dr. Hoenneger and escapes into the night. Abberline,who had been attending the demonstration,pursues him,shooting at him as he races along the rooftops. The Wolf Man kills people in a trolley before disappearing into the night. The next day a human Lawrence visits Gwen at her antique shop. They realize they have fallen in love. Abberline arrives and searches the shop. But Lawrence has already escaped and begun the long walk back to Blackmoor.Gwen studies lycanthropy and tracks down Maleva to ask her help. Maleva confirms that Lawrence cannot be cured and asks God to help Gwen do what she must. Abberline tracks Lawrence to Blackmoor,this time armed with silver bullets. Gwen makes her way there as well.Lawrence arrives at Talbot Hall and finds Singh&apos;s mauled body hanging in the foyer. He loads a gun with Singh&apos;s silver bullets and tracks John through the house. He finds John in the study. The silver bullets are duds and John beats Lawrence. When the full moon rises,they both transform into werewolves and fight to death. In their struggle,the room catches on fire. The Wolf Man kicks John into the fire,burning him alive,then decapitates him. Gwen arrives hoping to save Lawrence. When the Wolf Man attacks her,Abberline bursts in and shoots at him. As Gwen flees with Abberline&apos;s revolver,the Wolf Man bites Abberline but chases Gwen rather than finish him off.The Wolf Man traps Gwen above a waterfall. She lays down the gun and pleads with the man still inside the beast. Lawrence&apos;s consciousness faintly returns and the Wolf Man hesitates. When he is distracted by the sounds of a posse coming to kill him,Gwen retrieves the revolver and shoots him with a silver bullet. As he lays dying,Lawrence reverts to human form and thanks Gwen for doing what needed to be done. The wounded Abberline and the posse arrive as Lawrence dies.Universal Studios resurrects the classic lycanthrope with this tale of an American who experiences an unsettling transformation after returning to his ancestral home in Victorian-era Great Britain and being attacked by a rampaging werewolf. His brother having recently vanished without a trace,haunted nobleman Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate. What he discovers upon reuniting with his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins),however,is a destiny far darker than his blackest nightmares. As a young boy,the untimely death of his mother caused Talbot to grow up before his time. Though Talbot would attempt to bury his pain in the past by leaving the quiet Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor behind,the past returns with a vengeance when his brother&apos;s fiancée,Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt),convinces him to return home and aid the search for his missing brother. But something monstrous has been stalking the residents of Blackmoor from the nighttime shadows,something not quite human. Not even recently arrived Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) can dream up a rational explanation for the gruesome spell that has been cast over Blackmoor,yet rumors of an ancient curse persist to this very day. According to legend,the afflicted will experience a horrific transformation by the light of the full moon,their animal rage becoming far too powerful for their human bodies to contain. Now,the woman Talbot loves is in mortal danger,and in order to protect her he must venture into the moonlit woods and destroy the beast before it destroys her. But this isn&apos;t your typical hunt,because before the beast can be slain,a simple man will uncover a primal side of himself that he never knew existed. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker pens a film directed by Joe Johnston and featuring creature effects by special-effects makeup legend Rick Baker. [D-Man2010]Set in the late 1880s,the film keeps the plotline of the original,with Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) meeting his father (Anthony Hopkins) following the death (and in the remake,disappearance) of his brother. The film details events during Lawrence&apos;s past that led to his estrangement from his father (which includes Gwen),and the setting is changed from the mythical Welsh village of Llanwelly to the English village of Blackmore and the city of London. The official synopsis states Talbot was traumatized by his mother&apos;s death as a child,while Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) is his brother&apos;s fiancée. Following his brother&apos;s disappearance,Talbot hunts a murderer,which turns out to be a werewolf,and the curse is passed on.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with a ship in the ocean. Two workers think that they are transporting alcohol,and want to have a little taste. They open a container and find numerous drums inside. One of the drums is knocked over. They pick it up and open it,only to get a face full of toxic waste. The captain and crew hear an alarm go off and put on gas masks. They find the two workers,dead next to the open drum. The captain has the bodies thrown over the side of the ship. Elsewhere,Malcolm (David Atrakchi) drives his car to a police checkpoint. A cop requests to see his passport,and he shows it to him. The cop sees a woman sleeping in the backseat,and Malcolm says that shes tired from partying last night. The cop lets Malcolm through the checkpoint.Frank Martin (Jason Statham) and Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) enjoy a boring day of fishing in the ocean. They are at the spot that Tarconi used to fish with his father,and is surprised that they havent had any bites yet. Eventually,Tarconi gets a bite and Frank gets all excited,telling him to fight for the fish. Elsewhere,Malcolm gets to another police checkpoint and shows his papers to a cop. However,the cop tells Malcolm to get out of the car and bring his papers inside so that they can inspect it. He also tells him that the woman in the back needs to come inside as well. Malcolm looks nervous,and then he winds up speeding past the checkpoint. The cops chase Malcolm through the streets,but wind up crashing into a van. Tarconi,after losing the fish,gets the call about the chase and is surprised that Frank was not the driver. He tells Frank that hes going to have to cut their fishing day short,and they depart just as Frank gets a bite. At the airport,Johnson (Robert Knepper) and his men arrive in a private jet. When asked what his purpose is in the country,Johnson says that hes there for environmental protection. During this time we see Minister Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbe) talking with reporters about his plan to help save the environment. Vasilev goes into his office and finds a confidential envelope waiting on his desk. The envelope starts to ring,and he finds a cell phone inside. Johnson is on the other end of the line,and is watching Vasilev from across the street. Johnson works for a company that Vasilev refused to do business with,since they would cause harm to the environment. Johnson has been hired to convince him to reconsider,and tells him to look at the picture inside the envelope. Vasilev is shocked by what he sees,and Johnson tells him that hell be in contact with him.At night,Frank falls asleep watching a fishing show on TV at his house. He wakes up,and hears tires screeching. Suddenly,a car crashes into his house. The driver is Malcolm,and he is bloodied from the crash and having been shot. As Frank recognizes him,we see a flashback to when he was approached for a job. Frank declined,and instead gave the man Malcolms name and number to contact. The man was adamant that his boss wanted Frank because hes the best and wouldnt take no for an answer. Frank tried to leave,but became surrounded by henchmen in a room with a piano in it. They tried to make him reconsider,but Frank took off his jacket and beat the crap out of them all. Back to the present,Frank calls an ambulance to get help for Malcolm,who refuses to get out of the car. Frank sees that he has a metal device strapped around his wrist,and the paramedics show up. Malcolm,weak,tries to tell them something about the car but the paramedics load him into the ambulance and start to drive away. Frank inspects the car and then sees Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) in the backseat. He tries to get her to get out of the car so that he can help her,but she shows him that shes also wearing a metal device. Frank realizes that somethings wrong and runs after the ambulance. After a certain distance,the ambulance explodes. He goes back into his house and is immediately knocked out by someone.When Frank wakes up,he finds himself in a room wearing nothing but his underwearand a metal device around his wrist. He finds a suit in the closet and puts it on. Johnson walks in and says that he would like to hire him for a job,since Malcolm (his replacement) failed. Frank maintains that hes unavailable. Becoming annoyed with a henchman,Johnson shoots him in the forehead and then points the gun at Frank. He tells him that he has three seconds to accept the job or hell kill him. Frank has no choice but to take the job,under the condition that he drives his own car. Johnson had a feeling that he would want his car,and so he leads Frank to a garage. Johnson has had his men take out all the weapons from the car and has installed his own GPS. He also gives him a wad of cash for gas/food,and a cell phone that will only call Johnsons number. He tells Frank to think of this as more of a mission,and tells him to not disappoint. He also mentions that the metal device around his wrist is a bomb,and if he gets more than 75 feet away from the car,hell explode. Hell be released after completing the mission. Frank is about to get in when he sees that Valentina is sitting in the passenger seat. He says that he works alone,but says that hell take the girl when Johnson threatens to kill her. He gets into the car and,after loading two bags into the trunk,tells Frank to get driving. Meanwhile,Tarconi arrives at Franks house and wonders what the hell happened there. He has his cops set up a crime scene,and a cop tows away Malcolms car. However,the tow truck is blocked off by a car and the cop is shot through the windshield. The gunmen remove the GPS from Malcolms car and drive off.After getting through a police checkpoint,Frank calls Johnson and he tells him to punch in a code for the GPS. The next location he will have to go is Budapest (Hungary). Frank repeatedly tries to get Valentina to talk to him about whats going on,but she refuses. Meanwhile,Tarconi has found the tow truck and the dead cop inside. He reviews video footage from the tow truck and sees who the gunmen were. He also sees their license plate,and has his cops try to find them. Frank drives off the chosen path and Johnson is made aware of it,since his men are tracking the car. Johnson sends some henchmen to persuade Frank to get back on course,but warns his men not to kill him since they need him. Frank drives to a garage owned by his friend Otto (Timo Dierkes),whos also a tech whiz. He shows Otto the bomb around his wrist,and asks him if he can remove it. Otto cant,and says that he knows the Pentagon has been working on something like it in secret. He says that theres a transmitter somewhere in the car,and then Johnsons goons show up. Frank orders Otto to search his car for the transmitter while the henchmen order Frank to get driving. They grab wrenches &amp; poles,and attack Frank. As he beats his way through the men,Frank takes off his clothes and uses them as weapons. Eventually,he winds up shirtless and a giant henchman shows up. He throws Frank through a wall and beats him up. Frank tries to fight back,but his punches/kicks seem to hardly have any effect on him. The giant winds up getting stuck in the floor,and Frank bashes his head with a shovel. As Frank gets dressed,Valentina has obviously become attracted to him and helps straighten his tie. Otto finds the transmitter,but if he removes it the bombs will go off. Frank and Valentina drive away.While Valentina takes a nap in the back,Frank calls Johnson and tells him that he wants to talk face-to-face. Johnson says that hell be at Budapest,and to wait for his call. Frank arrives in Budapest and then sees a nearby pay phone ringing. He exits the car to answer it,and Johnson says that hes been thinking about their arrangement. Hes starting to think that anyone with a drivers license can do the mission,and so in the vein of Donald Trump,he fires Frank. A henchman steals Franks car and drives away. Frank chases him on foot,desperate to remain within distance. Valentina wakes up and sees that the new driver is not Frank. She starts to fight with him,trying to get him to stop the car,as Frank steals a bicycle and rides through a factory. Eventually,the driver stops to take care of Valentina. Frank rides his bicycle through a window,jumps through the drivers window,and kicks him out. Frank then drives off with Valentina. Meanwhile,the men that hired Johnson meet with Vasilev and order him to sign their contract,which also includes allowing the ship from the beginning to enter port without question. Vasilev buys some time by requesting 24 hours to review the contract. Also,Frank contacts Tarconi and informs him of the situation at hand. Frank talks with Johnson again,and agrees to do the mission. The next location he has to go to is Bucharest. Tarconi and his cops were listening in on the call,and are doing their best to trace Johnsons location but its difficult since he keeps on moving.Valentina says that shes hungry and describes what she wants to eat. She becomes more upbeat and puts on some make-up. When she does,she finds that she still has some drugs. She offers Frank a pill,but he refuses since hes more focused with driving. He tells her not to take the pills,but she does anyways. Valentina blasts some music and then says that she needs to pee. Frank pulls into a gas station and fills up the tank. Before Valentina goes inside,Frank reminds her not to go far from the car. Valentina goes inside the convenience store and pays for the gas. She eats some food and drinks some vodka in the back of the store. However,she is unable to get to the bathroom because its more than 75 feet from the car. Valentina resorts to pissing in the aisle while Frank becomes frustrated with her behavior. A car pulls up in front of the gas station,and a man gets out to piss on the side of the road. Frank gets suspicious and tells Valentina to get back in the car. She keeps on drinking the vodka and makes a scene at the gas pump. The guys in the car up ahead recognize Valentina and go into reverse. Frank throws the vodka away,shoves Valentina into the back,and speeds off. The other car tries to run Frank off the road,but fail. Frank calls Johnson and asks him why the car is chasing him. The guys in the other car are not Johnsons people,and so he tells Frank to drive faster while he figures out who they are. Two big trucks drive in both lanes on the road up ahead. Frank turns the car on its side and drives sideways between the trucks. He makes it past,and one of the trucks loses control. The other car chases Frank to a forest and fire at him with machine guns. Frank slams on the brakes just before the edge of a cliff. The other car drives over the cliff and explodes after falling.Frank rests his head on the steering wheel,and Valentina massages him because hes so tense. She then kisses the back of his neck,and Frank asks him what shes doing. She says that if theyre going to die,she wants to have sex one last time. Frank declines and gets out of the car. He looks in the trunk and finds that the two bags are filled with phone books. He then realizes that Valentina is the package hes transporting. She steals his keys and playfully walks away from the car. She says that she was turned on watching him fight shirtless earlier,and she wants him to do a striptease. Frank reluctantly takes off his shirt,but Valentina then requests a kiss. He kisses her,but she wants a kiss like he means it. Frank passionately kisses her,and they continue to make out even after he gets his keys back. Meanwhile,Johnson calls Vasilev and is furious that he sent some men to try to thwart his plan. Johnson says that if he ever wants to see his daughter Valentina again,hell have to play ball and sign the contract. Vasilev reveals that he knows who Johnson is and says that he wants to talk to his daughter before signing the contract. Johnson tries to call Frank,but hes too busy having sex with Valentina in the car. Hes also at a loss because since Frank is in the forest,hes out of range for them to track him.As Frank and Valentina overlook the valley,Valentina finally reveals what happened. She was at a nightclub partying with friends when someone gave her a drugged drink. She went to the bathroom and passed out. When she woke up,she was in the backseat of Malcolms car. She begged Malcolm to pull over and let her call her father. He did,even though it was against the rules. As she called her father,Johnsons henchmen showed up and chased them. They shot Malcolm in the back,and he told Valentina that he would make sure shes safe,which is why he crashed into Franks house. Frank and Valentina get back on the road,and Johnson calls them. He says that instead of going to Bucharest,hes going to take the next left and continue down the road. Valentina is afraid that they will kill Frank,but he tells her not to worry about it. Elsewhere,Tarconi visits Vasilev and works with him on getting his daughter back. Johnson calls and orders Vasilev to sign the contract,but he refuses until he hears Valentinas voice. He hangs up before Tarconi can trace his location. Frank winds up driving on a bridge,and becomes blocked on it (Johnson and his men are at both sides). Johnson orders Valentina to get out of the car and walk to him. Frank kisses her goodbye and tells her that hell be fine. Valentina walks over to Johnson,who removes her bomb,and spits in his face. Johnson punches her in the stomach and shoves her into a car. He then orders his men to kill Frank. They pump his car full of bullets,and Frank drives off the bridge into the water below. Johnson is satisfied,since hes dead either way (he stays,he drowns he leaves,he explodes).Underwater,Frank calls Tarconi and tells him where he is. Tarconi and the cops are ten minutes away and tell Frank to hang on. As Frank begins to drown,he swims to the trunk and takes out the two bags from earlier. He uses the air from the tires to blow air into the bags,which allows him to breathe. He then ties the bags to the car,and the air causes the car to float to the surface. Tarconi and the cops arrive just in time to see Frank &amp; his car being pulled out of the water by a tractor. Frank gets a new pair of clothes and works on his car to get it running again. Meanwhile,Johnson and his men arrive at a train station. He tells a henchman to buy tickets for the next train,since they need to keep moving. The henchman annoys Johnson and he almost kills him,but stops when he sees witnesses around. While on the train,Johnson calls Vasilev and lets him speak with Valentina. Tarconis cops are able to trace Johnsons location to the train. Franks car starts again,and he speeds off to save Valentina. Johnson says that he really hates violence,since it causes more problems than solutions,but sometimes its necessary to get what you want. Valentina then sees that Frank is driving alongside the train and smiles. Frank drives up ahead to a bridge and then drives off it,landing on top of the train. He jumps through a window and is fired upon by the henchmen. Johnson holds Valentina at gunpoint,but she bites his hand and runs off into the other cabs. Frank kicks a helmet at a goons face,grabs a machine gun,and kills all the henchmen. Johnson gets to Valentina again,and Frank runs after him. However,he is forced to stop due to being 75 feet from the car. Johnson dares Frank to takes one more step,but Frank runs away.While Tarconi and the cops give chase to the train,they see Frank climb on top of the train and climb back into his car. Johnson separates the cabs so that Franks section drifts away from them. Frank manages to drive his car from the top of the train into the cab where Johnson and Valentina are. Frank then gets out and beats the hell out of Johnson. He tries to stab Frank with a knife,but Frank knocks it away and continues to beat him. Johnson lands on the car and Frank grabs the key to remove his bomb. He then ties Johnsons arm to the car,straps the bomb to his wrist,and puts the car in reverse. Johnson panics and gets his arm loose from the car before it falls off the train. He then realizes that he shouldve stayed with the car,since he becomes 75 feet from it. Johnson explodes,causing the train to come to a halt. Frank finds Valentina and kisses her. Tarconi rescues them and calls Vasilev,telling him that his daughter is safe. Vasilev rips up the contract,and the ship from the beginning is raided by the police. Some time later,we see Frank and Tarconi fishing again in the ocean. Tarconi notes that Frank is changing,and we see that Valentina is with them,sunbathing on the boat. The film ends with Valentina telling them what she wants to eat.</Plot>

        <Plot>The story takes place in the fertile,eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built,wars fought,alliances forged,and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox),king of Mycenae,has united most of Greece&apos;s kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly,hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles,but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill,Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon,preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius,sealing Agamemnon&apos;s control over the nation,and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile,Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However,young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus&apos; beautiful wife,Helen (Diane Kruger),whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy,stowing her away on his brother&apos;s ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone,Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother,Agamemnon,who is only too happy to oblige,though Agamemnon&apos;s decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean),king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon,goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the conquest of Troy. He finds him sparring with his young cousin,Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund),who is more than eager to join in the fighting. But Achilles refuses to go,despite Odysseus&apos; assurance that this war will go down into history. Achilles later seeks advice from his mother,the sea nymph Thetis (Julie Christie),who is gathering shells to make a new necklace for him. She tells him that if he chooses to stay home he will find a wife,raise a family,and die old and loved. If he goes to Troy,he will find his eternal glory and history will remember his name for thousands of years. However,should he go to Troy,he is doomed to die and will never return.Meanwhile,Hector and Paris return to Troy with Helen,greeted warmly by their fellow Trojans. The city is guarded by a high,thick wall that has remained impenetrable since its founding. They meet their father,King Priam (Peter O&apos;Toole),who welcomes Helen and praises her beauty. Hector is reunited with his wife,Andromache (Saffron Burrows),and his infant son.Achilles decides to join Agamemnon&apos;s campaign against Troy but brings his own warriors,the Myrmidons,led by Eudorus (Vincent Regan). Patroclus accompanies them as well. The Myrmidons prove to be faster rowers than the Greeks and arrive on the shores of Troy before anyone else,though Achilles tells Patroclus to stay and watch the ship. They take the beach with ease and sack the Temple of Apollo where priestess and cousin of Hector and Paris,Briseis (Rose Byrne),is taken captive. In a defiant move,Achilles decapitates the statue of Apollo. Prince Hector leads an offensive to keep the Greeks at bay and runs into the temple where Achilles confronts him but refuses to fight him. Achilles explains that their fight would be suited best in front of an audience and he allows Hector to leave.Briseis is brought to Achille&apos;s hut as his prize. She berates him for killing priests of Apollo before he is summoned to see Agamemnon who is preparing to celebrate the victory. There,tensions rise as Achilles and the king argue over claims to the victory. Agamemnon goes further by bringing in Briseis,claiming her as his own spoil of war,which drives Achilles into a rage. He threatens to fight for her but she angrily interjects,saying that no one else will die for her. Achilles stays his blade,to the surprise of Agamemnon. Achilles vows that Agamemnon will one day fall under his sword.That night,Priam seeks the advice of his advisors and elders with his sons in attendance,discussing how best to defend against the Greeks. Paris offers an alternative to bloodshed; he will fight Menelaus for Helen&apos;s hand. The winner will take her home and the loser will burn before nightfall. Later,Priam speaks with Paris in a courtyard and admits that,in all the wars hes fought for power or land,a war fought for love makes more sense. He gives Paris the Sword of Troy,forged at its founding and containing the history of their nation. He explains that as long as a Trojan wields it there is hope for their people.Hector goes to see his wife and son. She fears for his life and can&apos;t imagine living on without him. He comforts her before getting up to see his brother. In the halls,he sees a cloaked figure and gives pursuit to find that it&apos;s Helen trying to leave the city. She is remorseful for being the sole reason so many Trojan men died that day but Hector tells her that returning to Menelaus will not end the war and that she is a princess of Troy now. Helen returns to Paris.The next day,Agamemnon&apos;s army marches for Troy while Achilles,still seething over his loss of Briseis,watches from a nearby hill with his men. Hector and Paris ride out to meet Agamemnon and Menelaus before battle. Agamemnon demands that the Trojans return Helen to his brother and submit to his rule. Hector bravely rebuffs but Paris offers to fight Menelaus one-on-one,hoping that will settle the dispute. While Agamemnon could care less about returning Helen to his brother,he allows Menelaus the opportunity to issue revenge. The two begin their fight and Menelaus is clearly stronger. Paris is wounded and disarmed but,before Menelaus can deliver a death blow,ducks away and crawls back to his brother. Stunned at his cowardice,Menelaus demands the fight to continue but Hector defends his brother and drives his sword through Menelaus,killing him. Enraged,Agamemnon charges forward with his army.Watching from his hilltop,Achilles can&apos;t help but curse under his breath at Agamemnon&apos;s inability to keep his ranks in formation. Hector proves to be the more able warrior and overpowers the Greeks with his tactics. One of the strongest Greek warriors,Ajax (Tyler Mane) is felled by Hector. Odysseus advises Agamemnon to fall back before he loses his entire army and the Greeks retreat to the beach where their archers provide defense.With Menelaus dead,the main reason for the assault on Troy is gone and Agamemnon struggles to think of a way to rally the troops to his cause. Odysseus suggests that Agamemnon put his reservations aside and enlist Achilles to fight again. Outside,Briseis is tossed around between Greek soldiers,having been given to them by Agamemnon. Before she can be cruelly branded,Achilles steps in and takes her back to his hut. He gives her a wet cloth to clean with and some food. When she questions why he fights and defies the gods,he shows her a more reflective side to his nature and explains that the gods are jealous of men for their short,mortal lives. As such,everything is more beautiful.Priam consults with his advisors again while Paris laments over his cowardice. Helen assures him that,though Menelaus was a strong warrior,she hated her life with him. She&apos;d rather have someone to love and grow old with than to see him die on the battlefield. Hector advises his father that the Greeks underestimated Trojan strength and that they should not do the same. However,General Glaucus (James Cosmo) wants to strike preemptively and High Priest Archeptolemus (Nigel Terry) claims Troy is favored by the gods,citing bird omens. Despite Hector&apos;s warnings to keep behind their walls,Priam favors his advisors and issues an attack before daybreak.As Achilles sleeps that night,Briseis takes a dagger and holds it to his throat. Without opening his eyes,he encourages her to kill him but she hesitates. They realize their feelings for each other and make love. Achilles decides that he&apos;s had enough of war and offers to take Briseis away from Troy. Afterwards,he speaks with Eudorus and tells him that they will go home. Hearing this,Patroclus is devastated,having hoped to take part in battle. Achilles returns to his hut.Just as dawn approaches,the Trojan army,led by Hector,set up on the dunes and sent hundreds of lit arrows into the sand. The Greeks awake in time to see large balls of hay being rolled down the hill towards camp,ignited in huge fireballs by the torched arrows. Banging their shields to intimidate,the Trojans advance towards the Greek camp. Suddenly,Achilles appears in his armor and rallies the troops to fight. Achilles fights his way towards Hector and the two engage in combat. Greeks and Trojans alike surround them,edging them on,until Hector slits Achilles&apos; throat with a swift thrust of the sword. Achilles falls,gasping for breath,while the Myrmidons look on in horror. But when Hector removes his helmet,he discovers that the man he wounded is not Achilles; its Patroclus. Hector,repentant but resolute,drives his sword into the boy&apos;s chest to finish him. He addresses Odysseus and tells him they&apos;ve fought enough that day. Before leaving,Odysseus tells Hector that Patroclus was Achilles&apos; cousin.The Myrmidons return to camp as Achilles emerges from his tent. Seeing them battle-worn,he asks why they disobeyed him. Eudorus laments that Patroclus disguised himself in Achilles&apos; armor,even moved like him,and fell under Hector. Achilles is outraged and attacks Eudorus. Briseis tries to stop him but he throws her to the ground.Hector returns to his wife. He admits that he killed a boy who was much too young and feels that his actions will have severe repercussions. He shows his wife a hidden passage under Troy that she can take civilians through to get to the mountains should he die and the walls be breached. Though she is upset to have to consider this,she heeds his advice.Achilles puts his cousin on a funeral pyre and sets it alight. Agamemnon watches and says,&quot;That boy may have just saved the war for us&quot;,knowing that the rage of Achilles will not wane until he&apos;s had revenge. Meanwhile,Helen watches as Paris practices his archery in preparation for battle,hitting his target time and again.The following morning,Achilles sets off to enact vengeance upon Hector. Briseis begs him not to go,but he ignores her. He rides to the gates of Troy and calls for Hector who dresses in his armor and says goodbye to his wife. He meets Achilles outside alone. Achilles throws down his helmet so that Hector can see his face. Though Hector tries to reason,Achilles is bent on bloodlust. As they begin to fight,Priam and Paris watch while Helen comforts Andromache who can&apos;t bring herself to look. Achilles overpowers Hector by driving his spear into his chest before finishing him with his sword. He then ties Hector&apos;s legs together behind his chariot and drags him away,back to the beach. When he returns to his hut,Briseis cries out and asks when the killing will stop before leaving.That night,Achilles is visited by a stranger in a cloak. The stranger kisses Achilles&apos; hand before revealing himself as none other than King Priam. Having stealthily entered the Greek camp unnoticed,Priam begs for his son&apos;s body back to be given a proper burial. He tells Achilles that,while Hector killed his cousin,he did not know who it was and he asks Achilles how many cousins and brothers he&apos;s killed in his time. Despite being enemies,he asks for respect. Achilles relents. He weeps over Hector&apos;s body,promising to meet him in the next life,before giving him to Priam. When Briseis comes forward,Achilles allows her to go home and apologizes for hurting her. He gives Priam his word that the Greeks will not attack Troy for 12 days to allot for proper mourning.When Menelaus hears of Achilles&apos; secret treaty with Priam,he becomes incensed. But Odysseus,who notices the sculpture of a horse a fellow soldier has made for his son,proposes a plan,putting the 12 days of mourning to their advantage.After 12 days,the Trojans discover that the beach has been abandoned and various bodies lie in the sand. They appear to have been taken by disease and,where the heart of the camp once was,a large wooden horse has been erected. Upon seeing this,Priam is advised that the horse was left as a gift to the god Poseidon and is encouraged to bring it back to Troy. Paris,who is suspicious,urges his father to burn the horse,but Priam brings the horse into the city where its revered as a sign of the end of the war. A Trojan scout,hiking through the cliffs outside the city,comes upon a cove apart from the main beach and discovers the Greek armada hiding there. However,he is killed by arrow before he can warn the rest of Troy.Meanwhile,the whole city celebrates into the night. Once everything has quieted down,the horse opens and Achilles,Odysseus,and a mass of Greek soldiers emerge from inside and open Troy&apos;s gates where the rest of the Greek army has gathered. They quickly infiltrate the city,pillaging and burning homes and killing any Trojan who stands in their way while a tearful Priam can only watch. Soldiers of Troy attempt to defend the royal palace,but fail. As Priam prays before the statue of Apollo and asks why he&apos;s been forsaken,Agamemnon comes up behind him and stabs him in the back. Achilles,meanwhile,searches the city for Briseis.Paris and Andromache lead surviving civilians down to the secret passage where Paris gives a young boy,Aeneas (Frankie Fitzgerald) (a progenitor of the Romans),the Sword of Troy,reciting what his father told him. He then returns with his bow and arrow to help fight.Briseis is praying before a statue of Apollo when she is grabbed from behind by Agamemnon. Achilles sees this and runs to her aid. Agamemnon tells Briseis his intent to take her back to Greece as his slave before she takes a concealed knife and fatally stabs him in the neck. His guards accost her but Achilles kills them. As he is helping her up,Paris arrives and shoots and arrow through Achilles&apos; heel. Standing up to face Paris,despite Briseis&apos; cries,Achilles is shot again through the chest. He removes the arrow only to be shot again and again,each time removing the arrow. He finally collapses and tells Briseis that she was his peace in a lifetime of war and urges her to escape. Briseis goes with Paris and they leave as the Greeks arrive at the palace to find Achilles dead,seemingly taken by a single shot to the heel (thus perpetuating the myth surrounding his death).Achilles&apos; body is burned honorably on a funeral pyre within the ruins of Troy the following day as Odysseus watches and exalts,&quot;If they ever tell my story,let them say I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat,but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector,tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles.&quot;</Plot>

        <Plot>Background: 1400 years ago,Vampires had decided that the best way to&#x0A;ensure the survival of their species was for three Elders--Viktor,Marcus,&#x0A;and Amelia--to &apos;leap frog&apos; through time,one ruling while the other two&#x0A;slept,each being awakened at their appointed time according to a&#x0A;never-to-be-broken covenant. 1,000 years ago,during the reign of Viktor,&#x0A;the oldest and strongest of the Elders,the Vampire-Lycan War began. 600&#x0A;years ago,Kraven set the &apos;great blaze&apos; which killed Lucian,the leader of&#x0A;the Lycans. Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian&apos;s arm as proof of&#x0A;his death,a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor,who put&#x0A;Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to&#x0A;scatter. Vampire Death Dealers,armed with silver bullets and shuriken,have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene,Rigel,and Nathaniel -- follow&#x0A;two Lycans into the subway. A firey battle ensues in which Rigel is&#x0A;killed,one of the Lycans gets away,and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the fracas,&#x0A;Selene [Kate Beckinsale] makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet&#x0A;bullet,and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under&#x0A;the subway. Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires,but they are more&#x0A;interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight&apos;s party with&#x0A;the coven from across the &apos;great ocean&apos; in celebration of the upcoming&#x0A;awakening of Marcus by Amelia,the current reigning Elder. Not interested&#x0A;in their gaities,Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the&#x0A;Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human. A&#x0A;computer search reveals the human is Michael Corvin [Scott Speedman],an intern at a local&#x0A;hospital. Meanwhile,the wounded Lycan` has returned to the Lycan den with&#x0A;the bad news that he lost the candidate he was tailing,as well as to have&#x0A;the silver bullets and stars dug out of his body so that he can regenerate.Selene pays Michael Corvin&apos;s apartment a visit. While snooping,she&#x0A;overhears a phone message about his involvement in some &apos;shoot out.&apos; Now&#x0A;convinced that she is right about the Lycans stalking Michael,she tries&#x0A;to interrogate him just as his apartment is raided by a pack of Lycans.&#x0A;While Selene holds them off,Michael escapes in the elevator,but the&#x0A;doors open to a face-to-face confrontation with Lucian [Michael Sheen],the&#x0A;current leader of the Lycans. Selene attempts to shoot Lucian,but he is&#x0A;intent on biting Michael and spitting the blood into a vial which he takes&#x0A;to Singe [Erwin Leder],who has been researching humans with the last name of Corvin,so&#x0A;far with negative results. He analyzes Michael&apos;s blood and pronounces it&#x0A;&apos;positive.&apos;Selene and Michael make a getaway together,but Selene has lost a lot&#x0A;of blood in her fight with the Lycans. She passes out,the car leaps into&#x0A;a river. Michael saves her,binds her wound,then passes out himself. When&#x0A;Selene awakens,she takes the unconscious Michael back to the Vampire&apos;s&#x0A;mansion,incurring the wrath of Kraven [Shane Brolly],who wants Selene to be his future&#x0A;queen and is jealous that she seems smitten with Michael. When Michael&#x0A;finally comes to,he is face-to-face with Erika [Sophia Myles],who realizes that Michael&#x0A;has been bitten and is becoming Lycan. Erika leaps to the ceiling and&#x0A;starts hissing at him. Scared shitless,Michael jumps out a window and&#x0A;escapes the Vampire&apos;s mansion.Although it is forbidden to delve into the past,Selene decides to do&#x0A;a little reading about the history of the Vampire-Lycan War,particularly&#x0A;the chapter on the Fall of Lucian. She notices that the Lucian in one of&#x0A;the pictures is wearing the same medallion that she noticed the current&#x0A;Lucian wearing during the fight at Michael&apos;s apartment. Could he and the&#x0A;Lucian that Kraven supposedly killed 600 years ago be one and the same?&#x0A;Could Kraven and Lucian be conspiring together? Could the fact that the&#x0A;Lycans are amassing near the Vampire coven portend an attack on the&#x0A;Vampires? When Erika informs Selene that Michael has been bitten and is&#x0A;turning Lycan,Selene has heard enough. Against the covenant rules,Selene&#x0A;decides to awaken Viktor and ask for his guidance.Michael has begun having hallucinations and wants to know what is&#x0A;happening to him. Selene takes him to their Lycan interrogation room so&#x0A;that he can hide for the night. She also gives him the good news --he has&#x0A;been bitten by a Lycan,and during the next full moon (tomorrow night),he&#x0A;will turn into one. The hallucinations,she tells him,are memories passed&#x0A;to him from Lucian. When Michael asks Selene why she cares about what&apos;s&#x0A;happening to him (&apos;Do you intend to bite me,too?&apos;),Selene explains that&#x0A;the lycan virus and the vampire virus are incompatible and no one has ever&#x0A;survived a bite by both species. When Michael asks her why she hates&#x0A;Lycans so much,she tells him how Lycans slaughtered her entire family and&#x0A;how Viktor arrived just in time to save her from the same fate. Viktor&#x0A;made her vampire and then raised her like his own daughter.&#x0A;Selene then handcuffs Michael to a chair,gives him a gun with silver&#x0A;bullets,and advises him to use it on himself if she isn&apos;t back by&#x0A;tomorrow night.Back at the mansion,Viktor [Bill Nighy] has fully awakened and is being briefed&#x0A;by Kraven. When Viktor learns that he&apos;s been awakened a full century ahead&#x0A;of schedule,he is livid. Not even Selene&apos;s attempts to explain her&#x0A;findings appease him. In fact,Viktor basically tells Selene to let Kraven&#x0A;handle this and that she will be judged by the council for breaking the&#x0A;covenant. Kraven locks Selene in her room.It is the night of the full moon. It is time for Amelia&apos;s train to&#x0A;arrive,and Kraven has ordered Soren [Scott McElry] and his team to fetch her and the&#x0A;council members. Erika,who has wanted to be Kraven&apos;s mate for a long&#x0A;time,cuts the power to the main gate,allowing Selene to run to Michael.&#x0A;Selene releases Michael,but they are attacked by Lycans. Selene stays to&#x0A;fight while Michael jumps out a window. When Michael lands on his feet&#x0A;some five or six stories below,he is immediately captured by Lycans&#x0A;posing as cops. On the way to the Lycan den,Michael begins the change.&#x0A;The Lycans pull over,and they dose Michael with an enzyme to stop the&#x0A;change.Selene has captured Singe and brings him to Viktor where Singe is&#x0A;forced to explain how,for years,the Lycans have been trying to combine&#x0A;the blood lines. They&apos;ve been testing descendents of Alexander Corvinus,a&#x0A;15th century Hungarian warlord who was the sole survivor of a plague that&#x0A;ravaged his village and turned him into the first immortal. From&#x0A;Corvinus&apos;s offspring,one became the Vampire line,one became the Lycan&#x0A;line,and one remained human but carried the imprint of the original&#x0A;immortality virus hidden in its genetic code in dormant form and passed&#x0A;down through the ages to Michael Corvin. Lucian plans to inject himself&#x0A;with blood taken from Michael and from a powerful Vampire elder,creating&#x0A;a hybrid--both Lycan and Vampire--but stronger than both.Concerned that Amelia has not yet arrived,a group of Vampires are&#x0A;sent to find out what&apos;s taking so long. They find that Amelia and the&#x0A;council members have all been assassinated,having been bitten by Lycans.&#x0A;In addition,Amelia&apos;s blood has been totally drained. When Viktor finds&#x0A;out,he orders Selene to kill Michael.Meanwhile,Michael is being held at the Lycan den,where his visions&#x0A;have suddenly become clear and he now knows what started the Vampire-Lycan&#x0A;war. Many years ago,Lycans were the renfields for Vampires,but it was&#x0A;forbidden for Vampires and Lycans to fraternize. Lucian and Viktor&apos;s&#x0A;daughter Sonja fell in love and mated,creating a hybrid child that Viktor&#x0A;would not allow,so he (Viktor) placed Sonja,his own daughter in the sun&#x0A;where she burnt to a crisp while Lucian was made to watch--&apos;His own&#x0A;daughter burnt alive just for loving me,&apos; says Lucian poignantly--and&#x0A;Viktor has spent the last 600 years exterminating the Lycan species so the&#x0A;bloodlines will never blend.Kraven knows he&apos;s been found out. He was indeed in league with&#x0A;Lucian. Together,they planned Lucian&apos;s &apos;death&apos; 600 years ago so that&#x0A;Lucian could lay low. Now the agreement is for Kraven to gain control of&#x0A;both covens by obtaining an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans,while&#x0A;Lucian gets revenge on Viktor.Time to knock off a few main characters. The Vampires,along with Selene,Kahn,and Viktor storm the Lycan&#x0A;den. Kraven shoots Lucian with a silver nitrate bullet (The silver is in&#x0A;liquid form so that it will go directly into the Lycans&apos; bloodstreams and&#x0A;cannot be dug out). When Michael tries to escape,he is also shot by&#x0A;Kraven. As Michael lays oozing silver nitrate from his wounds,Kraven&#x0A;tells Selene the true story about her &apos;dark father,&apos; Viktor. Her family&#x0A;wasn&apos;t killed by Lycans but by Viktor himself. Seems he didn&apos;t like the&#x0A;taste of livestock very much,so once in a while he would engorge himself&#x0A;on human blood. Since Selene reminded him of Sonja,he spared her and&#x0A;raised her as his own. Selene is stunned.When Kraven demands that Selene go with him,she refuses. As he&apos;s&#x0A;about to shoot Michael again,the dying Lucian runs a sword through&#x0A;Kraven&apos;s leg and tells Selene to bite Michael. &apos;Half vampire,half lycan&#x0A;-- they&apos;re stronger than both.&apos; Selene does it. Kraven finishes off&#x0A;Lucian. Michael turns into a hybrid [Lycampire or Vampthrope?] and,after&#x0A;Michael and Viktor tussle a bit,Selene cuts off Viktor&apos;s head. Selene is&#x0A;now to become the hunted. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]</Plot>

        <Plot>NOTE: Sequel to Underworld (2003)&#x0A;.&#x0A;Underworld: Evolution opens with Vampire Selene [Kate Beckinsale] recapping the events in Underworld. Selene had been a Death&#x0A;Dealer for the Vampire clan for 600 years when she was betrayed. She explains&#x0A;how Kraven [Shane Brolly],ruler of the Vampire clan,formed a secret alliance with&#x0A;Lucian [Michael Sheen],ruler of the Lycan clan. When the Lycans found a third bloodline&#x0A;(human) that also descended from ancestor Alexander Corvinus,they tracked down&#x0A;descendent Michael Corvin [Scott Speedman] and turned him into a Lycan. After a big fight&#x0A;between Lycans and Vampires,Lucian was killed by Kraven. Before Michael&#x0A;died,however,Lucian told Selene to bite Michael: &quot;Half Vampire,half Lycan --&#x0A;they&apos;re stronger than both.&quot; Thus,Selene turned Michael into the first Hybrid.&#x0A;Selene then beheaded Elder Viktor,and she and Michael went into hiding.With two of the three vampire Elders destroyed [see Underworld],&#x0A;Selene&apos;s only hope is to awaken the last remaining Elder,Marcus [Tony Curran],who is still&#x0A;in hibernation,and expose the truth before Kraven can kill Marcus. Selene&#x0A;hides Michael in a safehouse and heads over to the Vampire mansion to plead her&#x0A;case. Unfortunately,Kraven has already attempted to awaken Marcus,who has&#x0A;morphed into some sort of batlike creature,and Marcus has killed Kraven as&#x0A;well as all the other Vampires in the mansion. By drinking Kraven&apos;s blood,&#x0A;Marcus learned everything that has transpired while he was in hibernation,&#x0A;including the making of Michael into a Hybrid.&#x0A;Marcus locates the safehouse in which Michael is hiding,but Michael has&#x0A;gone out for a bite to eat. After downing half a plate of potatoes and cabbage,&#x0A;he begins to retch (being half Vampire,he needs to feed on blood). Suddenly a&#x0A;newsflash is shown of him on the television. Several of the restaurant patrons&#x0A;try to hold him with their guns,but Michael escapes. Selene realizes that&#x0A;Michael is gone and goes after him. Michael has been shot several times and is&#x0A;in need of blood,so Selene makes him drink some of hers.Just then,Marcus flies in. He attempts to drink from Selene (to gain her&#x0A;memories and knowledge),but Michael pumps a few bullets into him. Selene and&#x0A;Michael steal a truck and outrun Marcus,who flies behind them. Suddenly,&#x0A;Selene notices the sun is about to rise. Michael helps her drive the truck into&#x0A;a warehouse and darkens the windows with paint. The two of them hole up there&#x0A;for the day. Big love scene follows. After sunset,Selene and Michael go looking for Andreas Tannis [Steven Mackintosh],&#x0A;Vampire and exiled historian of Vampire history,in order to get him to&#x0A;identify a pendant necklace that has been in Selene&apos;s possession since&#x0A;childhood. Selene learns from Tannis that the pendant is actually a key to&#x0A;Lycan William&apos;s prison,a place that was built by Selene&apos;s father. Selene now learns&#x0A;the truth about the slaughter of her family: Viktor did it to keep anyone from&#x0A;knowing William&apos;s whereabouts. Selene is the only one left who might remember&#x0A;where William&apos;s prison is located,and that memory is locked in her&#x0A;subconscious. It is for this reason that Marcus wants her blood...so that he&#x0A;can find William. Viktor did not fear for William and Marcus&apos;s lives when he&#x0A;ordered William imprisoned for all eternity. He feared that destroying William&#x0A;would destroy the entire Lycan bloodline,thus leaving the Vampires without&#x0A;slaves.Tannis arranges a meeting between Selene and Lorenz Macaro [Derek Jacobi],the only one&#x0A;who may have the power to stop Marcus. Before Selene and Michael can get to&#x0A;Lorenz Macaro,however,Marcus gets to Tannis and learns that there were&#x0A;actually two keys,the one with Selene and the other sewed inside Viktor&apos;s&#x0A;abdomen,a key that was removed by Alexander Corvinus upon Viktor&apos;s death.&#x0A;Lorenz Macaro turns out to be Alexander Corvinus. Selene begs him to help her&#x0A;stop Marcus,but he refuses to kill his own son. Suddenly,Marcus appears.&#x0A;Michael tries to fight him,but Marcus impales Michael through the chest and&#x0A;takes Selene&apos;s key that Michael was holding at the time. Selene shoots Marcus,&#x0A;who flies off. She removes the impalement from Michael&apos;s chest,then drains her&#x0A;own blood over the gaping wound...to no avail. Michael is dead.Marcus runs a sword through his father and takes the key that his father&#x0A;took from Viktor&apos;s chest. Marcus is now in possession of both keys. As he lay&#x0A;dying,Alexander slits his wrist and makes Selene drink his blood in order to&#x0A;pass on the legacy. &quot;What will I become?&quot; she asks. &quot;The future,&quot; Alexander&#x0A;replies. As a helicopter takes off,carrying Selene cradling Michael&apos;s body,&#x0A;Alexander blows himself up.Now that Marcus has both keys and the knowledge of where the door lies,he&#x0A;opens it and finds William waiting. Selene leads the helicopter to where she&#x0A;remembers a secret passage into the prison and enters,along with a few&#x0A;backups. Once in,they hear the roar of a werewolf and meet up with William.&#x0A;Selene fires at William just as Marcus appears. Selene fires at Marcus,slowing&#x0A;him just long enough to get through the open door and close it behind her.&#x0A;Unfortunately,a bit of rock prevents the door from closing all the way.&#x0A;William catches up with Selene again. She fires at him repeatedly and blows up&#x0A;the cavern in which they are located. Suddenly,all the backups killed by&#x0A;William begin to turn into werewolves and converge on Selene.Meanwhile,back in the helicopter,Michael lives! He leaps from the&#x0A;helicopter into the fracas and helps Selene battle with William. However,&#x0A;Marcus has managed to get the door open,and he,too,joins the melee. The&#x0A;first thing he does is to grab on to a rope hanging from the helicopter and&#x0A;bring it tumbling down into the cavern where it catches on a catwalk and lies&#x0A;there,blades still spinning. Now it&apos;s Michael against William and Selene&#x0A;against Marcus. Eventually,Michael manages to behead William,and Selene&#x0A;shoves Marcus into the helicopter blades,tearing him to pieces.As the sun comes up and Selene realizes that she is no longer burned by&#x0A;the light,thanks to Alexander Corvinus&apos;s blood,she and Michael enter each&#x0A;others&apos; arms. Big kiss scene follows. [Synopsis by bj_kuehl]</Plot>

        <Plot>The film begins with a monologue by Selene (Kate Beckinsale),telling the story of the lycans and vampires. It has been 20 years since the war between them has begun. Viktor (Bill Nighy) has built up an army of vampires to fight off the threat and have begun the process of exterminating the lycans. It appears that when someone is infected by a lycan,they transform into were-wolves,but do not change back and appear to behave like vicious animals rather than people. However,one day,in a prison cell,Viktor hears the cries of a human child,and investigates. What he discovers is a human child born of a lycan later named Lucian. Viktor contemplates killing the child,but could not bring himself to do it.Lucian grows up,and appears to be stronger and more focused than others of his kind; this is evident when Viktor tests him by making him fight vampires. Viktor decides to make more of Lucians kind (the new lycans that have human form). Viktor uses Lucian to make more like him by starving him and letting him feed on human slaves. The ones that survived became the new lycans,a new slave race to serve the vampires. The vampires think they have control of the lycans,but this may not be the case for long.Note: there are two types of were-wolves in this film,ones that are permanently in wolf form and wild,and ones that can transform when its a full moon and are in service to the vampires. I will refer to the former as wolves,and the latter as lycans.Cut to the present,a horseman is riding through the woods at night,pursued by something. At the castle,Viktor is discussing politics and finances with his advisors,Coloman (David Ashton) and Orsova (Elizabeth Hawthorne). The wolves have been attacking the human slaves,which Viktor replies with some variation of I dont give a crap,however,human slaves are their principle source of food and income (the human nobility pay Viktor for protection against the wolves),so they have to take action and hunt down the creatures.Back with the rider in the woods,wolves are pursuing the rider through a dark canyon but he is able to fight them off but there are an increasingly larger number of them. The situation looks grim but as the rider approaches the castle,the other vampires are prepared. They arm huge crossbows and mow down the lycans. One of the wolves lunges at the rider but is killed mid-air by a crossbow bolt from Lucian (who is still serving the vampires).The rider removes his helmet,and it turns out to be Sonja. Who is less than grateful to Lucian for saving her life,and just bosses him around. Viktor on the other hand,believes in giving credit where it is due. Viktor asks if Lucian minds killing his own kind,who replies that they are just animals and not his own kind. Lucian stares at Sonja,and Viktor reminds Lucian that is a servant,and should keep his eyes on the ground.Sonja and Viktor argue because he wants her to stay in the castle and leave the wolves to the death-dealers but Sonja is a great fighter and very stubborn. Sonja is Viktors daughter,and a council member,and Viktor does not want her to come to harm,and is grooming Sonja to become an elder; but she is endangering her position on the council by being a renegade and disobeying Viktor and missing council meetings.Outside,Lucian is burning the corpse of the dead wolf which he killed when it was chasing Sonja through the castle gates. As the corpse burns,it changes back into human form. The other lycans are being whipped,beaten,and forced to work for the vampires. One vampire guard gets a little too enthusiastic with the whip and Lucian tells him to stop. The vampire takes this badly,calls Lucian a dog,and leaves angrily Lucian is Viktors favourite servant and holds some power in the work yard. The other lycans seem to respect him.In the council chambers,Viktor is speaking with the other Coloman and Orsova regarding how to handle the situation with the wolves. Viktor doesnt think of it as such a big deal but Coloman note that the wolves are killing humans,which is destroying their main food source. Although they dont seem to be killing off too many humans,the fact that the vampires of this region are losing their crop,makes them look weak to the human nobles,who give the vampires people (for food) and money/gold for protection. Coloman suggests letting the lycans patrol outside during the day (since vampires cant do so). Viktor is very much against this suggestion as it would be granting the lycans more freedom,and increase risk of losing control. Coloman suggests making a privileged class of lycans,with better accommodations,rations,and status,led by a lycan that they can trust Lucian; this way,they will have one of the lycans controlling the others,and have the ability to control the wolves during the day. Viktor is still against the idea,but without Sonja there to support him,he has no choice but to take the suggestion under advisement. The human nobles will arrive the next day and Viktor will have to make his decision soon.Outside,the work shift is over,and the lycans are herded back into their cages. Lucian sneaks off,and gets into the sewers. He takes these passages and gets outside the castle,climbing up to a ruined sentry post,where he is met by Sonja. It turns out that they have been lovers the whole time,and Sonja acts cruel to Lucian in public to prevent suspicion. They kiss rather passionately. After some lovemaking Lucian asks if Sonja would go with him if he leaves (escapes). Sonja doesnt think its possible as he would be hunted down by Viktor and his army. Lucian reveals a crude key that he has made to remove the collar on his neck. All lycans in servitude have a collar with spikes pointing inward to prevent them from transforming,if they do,they die from impaling themselves on the spikes. If Lucian can get out of the collar,he would be able to fight the Vampires and escape. Sonja does not want Lucian to risk his life,but he believes that his kind should be equals,not slaves as both lycans and vampires are descendants of the Corvinus bloodline,brothers that took different paths to immortality.When Sonja and Lucian part,they are spotted by Tannis,one of Viktors lieutenants,sent to watch over Sonja. He realizes that Sonja and Lucian are having an affair,but does not tell Viktor.The human nobles arrive and Sonja goes out to escort them in. Lucian is worried and does not want her to go. Tannis has orders from Viktor for Sonja to not leave the castle walls,but she just ignores him. As Sonja leaves,Tannis sees Lucian,and subtly lets Lucian know that he knows their secret.Sonja and more vampire guards arrive to escort the human nobles and their slaves,and they hear howling in the distance. Lucian hears the howling and knows that there are more wolves than Sonja and her men can handle. Lucian tries to warn the others,but no one listens to him,so he runs out to save Sonja,disobeying orders and knocking out some guards along the way.Cut back to Sonja,wolves are pouring in from every direction. The vampires are holding them off,but there are too many. One of the human slaves appears to fight wolf and actually survives its Raze (Kevin Grevioux) from the first film,but as a human. Sonja is injured,but Lucian arrives in time and defends her. Lucian uses his key to open his collar and transform. The transformed Lucian gives off a deafening roar that drives off the wolves. Raze sees this and appears impressed. Viktor and his men arrive and Lucian changes back to human form. It is forbidden for a slave lycan to transform and Lucian is beaten and arrested,even though he saved Sonjas life. Sonja tries to plead with Viktor,but gets nowhere.Back at the castle,Viktor feels betrayed. Lucian is sentenced to a severe lashing by the same guard that he had angered earlier. The whip is tipped with huge hooks and tears up Lucians back. Sonja hears Lucians screams of pain and is devastated.After his punishment,Lucian is dragged back into his cage,next to a prison cell with the human slaves. Raze is in the cage next to Lucian,and gives him water to drink.Viktor is suspicious of Sonja for pleading to Viktor to release Lucian,but she claims that she was just showing gratitude for saving his life.Lucian and Raze talk,and Raze notes that he saw what happened in the forest- that the wolves appeared to obey Lucian when he transformed. Lucian begins talk of escape and freedom and the human slaves,although afraid,are intrigued. Just then,Sonja appears and Lucian and tells her that he has to leave. There is no one else that the two can trusts,except maybe for Tannis,since he knows their secret but did not tell,it means that he wants something. Lucian asks Sonja to speak to Tannis and figure out what he wants.Viktor meets with the nobles who are expected to pay tribute for protection from the wolves. This years tribute is low,and Viktor expects more due to increased attacks from the wolves. One of the nobles is fed up and proclaims that Viktor and his army are losing ground,and can barely keep the wolves from their own door. Viktor kills the nobleman and sustains control through fear.Down in the dungeons,the vampires are amused by the sight of the lycans fighting with one another over the food given to them. Lucian cant take any more of this and rallys the lycans for rebellion.In Sonjas room,she has a flashback of Viktor giving her a medallion,the same one featured in the first two films. Sonja goes to Tannis and,holding a dagger to his throat,asks him why he did not reveal the truth to Viktor. Tannis explains that Viktor isnt good with taking bad news,and that it is not yet the time for him to use this information to his advantage. Tannis wants a council seat,and there are only 12 seats and vampires dont die,which means that he cannot get onto the council unless someone relinquishes their position. Sonja agrees to give Tannis her seat on the council for his help.Sonja goes to Lucian and tells him that Viktor plans to execute him the next evening,and that he has to leave at dawn if he is to survive. They agree to meet in the forest in three days. As Tannis walks by,he tosses a collar key to Lucian.The human slaves are brought out and are purposely bitten by a transformed lycan to change them into lycans so they can serve as slaves and guards for the vampires. Lucian talks to the newly transformed lycans (including Raze) and talks them into joining him in escaping/revolting.As the guard (the one who whipped Lucian) comes in to check on the slaves,Lucian removes his collar,transforms,and shreds him. The slaves break free,subdue their guards,and make a break for it. The guards notice this pretty quickly and turn their crossbows on the lycans. Many of the lycans are killed before getting very far,and many others are separated by a barrage of arrows. Lucian has no choice but to escape with the few slaves that got free,but vows to return for the others. Lucian continues to charge outward,running into two vampires and throwing them and him out a window and out into the open. As they fall from the top of the castle,the guards turn to dust (its daytime),and Lucian lands safely on the ground. The few other lycans follow Lucian and make their escape.&#x0A;Click HereViktor is rather angry and notices that the collars were unlocked. He had given Tannis the key that Lucian had made,and believes that Tannis has betrayed him,but he claims that he had locked the key in the armory and asks Viktor to check to prove his innocence.Outside,Lucian and the four other lycans have made it to the surrounding forests,but instead of fleeing,Lucian plans to return to the castle to save his brethren. They have no weapons and are few in number,so Lucian asks Raze to lead him back to the noblemans estate so they are get the supplies and soldiers they need.At the castle armoury,Tannis finds the key that he had put away. Viktor believes that Lucian must have made another one and Tannis gets off the hook.Cut back to Lucian and the other lycans. Lucian has freed the human slaves that belonged to the nobleman (the one that was killed by Viktor). Lucian asks them to volunteer to help them,and if they choose to,be granted immortality through becoming a lycan. The freed slaves agree and they prepare for battle making weapons and arming themselves. Lucian sends Raze to other estates to recruit more soldiers.Viktor is back at the castle,pacing about and steps over a loose metal grate,the same one Lucian used to sneak out and meet with Sonja. He follows the passageway to Sonja and Lucian&apos;s secret meeting place.Back to Lucian,he heads into the woods and meets/recruit the wolves. The wolves do not attack Lucian and seem to listen to him.Viktor goes to Sonjas room,and questions her about Lucians escape. Viktor does not believe her and drinks her blood to see her memories. Viktor goes into a complete freak-out as he realizes that his daughter has betrayed him. Sonja is imprisoned in her chambers and Viktor storms out.At the lycan camp,Sonja is supposed to meet Lucian,but her absence worries him. Lucian insists on waiting for her,but the others do not want to wait; the longer they wait,the more likely they will be found.At the castle,the council have found out that Lucian is rallying the slaves and making more lycans,and the council pressures Viktor to do something about Lucian. Viktor knows that Lucian will return for Sonja,and prepares for the inevitable attack. Viktor sends one of Sonjas friends to tell Lucian that Sonja will be executed soon. Lucian knows it is a trap and heads back to the castle alone,giving Raze command of the troops (lycans and wolves).During the night,Lucian sneaks into the castle,dispatching the guards one by one. He reaches Sonja and they attempt to escape together. Lucian and Sonja run through the sewers but encounter heavy resistance. Up top,Viktor and his men pour oil into the sewers and set the tunnels on fire. Lucian and Sonja jump through a small hole in the ceiling and battle the vampires. Lucian is outnumbered and getting pummelled but Sonja is doing a good job fighting them off (partly because they want her alive). Viktor comes in and fights Sonja,and she has no choice but to defeat her father. Sonja pleas for Viktor to release Lucian for the sake of her child (shes pregnant with Lucians child). Viktor grabs Sonjas dagger and subdues her. Viktor sees the child as an abomination and believes he has no choice but to punish her as well. Lucian regrets escaping but Sonja tells him that it is not his fault,and that the choices are her to make.Sonja and Lucian are dragged out for a trial. The guards shoot two silver arrows into Lucian&apos;s back,so that he cannot transform. Sonja is convicted of treason by the council,and even Viktor declares Sonja as guilty,even though it visibly pains him to do so. Lucian pleads with Viktor to release Sonja,but its no use. Sonja and Lucian are brought into a chamber where Sonja is strung up on a pillar and forced to watch as Lucian is chained and whipped severely. The whipping ends and all the vampires leave. It will be dawn soon and Sonja will be executed by sunlight. The ceiling opens and Lucian tries to break free to save her,but cannot because he still has the two silver arrowheads buried in his back. Sonja says goodbye and is instantly fried by sunlight. Viktor is grieving rather heavily as well.At sunset,Lucian is still chained to the floors of the sunlight execution room. Viktor comes in to see the remains of his daughter but does not notice the full moon.Lucian is furious at Viktor and the moonlight gives him the strength he needs to force the arrowheads from his back and transform himself. He then breaks free,grabs Sonjas medallion and tries to escape. Lucian is being pummelled with arrows and is severely injured,but is able to let off a vicious roar,signalling his men,before weakening and returning to human form.Viktor gets his knife and is prepared to kill Lucian but notices that something is approaching a hoard of lycans and wolves charging towards the castle. The vampires man their crossbows and fire but there are just too many of them. The wolves climb up the walls easily and quickly overruns the vampires. Raze finds Lucian and helps him. Lucian tells Raze to free the others. Raze frees the other lycan prisoners and give them the keys to their collars. The lycans transform and fight their way out.Viktor gets Tannis to retrieve the other elders (hibernating in their coffins) and then heads out to face the lycans. Viktor proves to be a very powerful warrior and takes down many lycans. Lucian spots Viktor and heads right for him.Down in the sewers,Tannis has the elders in a boat and row them to safety.Lucian catches up with Viktor and they fight. Both of them fall into a pit,hanging from chains. Lucian is able weaken Viktor with sunlight (broke a hole through the wall) and ties him up in the chains. Viktor says he should have killed Lucian long ago,but is interrupted by a sword through his mouth. Lucian,thinking that he has killed Viktor,tosses his chained body into the water.Outside,Raze claims that its finished,but Lucian says it has just begun. This is the beginning of the second vampire-lycan war.On a ship off the coast,Viktor has been recovered by Tannis,and is put into his coffin to sleep/recover while the next elder reigns over the vampires.The film ends with the first minute of the first film,with Kravens (Shane Brolly) speech to Selene (Kate Beckinsale) revealing that Viktor had killed her family,and that he kept her alive because she reminded him of his daughter.</Plot>

        <Plot>The opening credits roll over a montage of aerial shots of the ground as seen from an airplane in flight, as Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings sing &quot;This Land Is Your Land.&quot; The plane lands and we see a series of talking heads -- people who have just been fired. Their reactions run the gamut from incredulousness and sadness to anger, and are directed at Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who is sitting calmly behind a desk. He works for CTC, Career Transition Counseling. In a voice-over, Ryan introduces himself: &quot;I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve&apos;s boss, who don&apos;t have the balls to sack their own employees.&quot; There&apos;s a quick montage of retaliatory actions a disgruntled fired employee might engage in (pouring bleach in the coffee, sniper shooting), and we see Ryan offer a pat, sincere consolation to Steve, a fired employee.In a hotel room, experienced traveler Ryan expertly packs his suitcase. We see him drop off his rental car at an airport, bypassing the vacationers in the airport to check in at the frequent flyer desk, and powering through security with practiced moves as his voice-over lyrically describes the airport as his home. In first class, the stewardess asks him, &quot;Cancer?&quot; He looks at her quizzically. &quot;Cancer?&quot; He is confused, and she holds up a soft drink can, repeating, patiently: &quot;Can, sir?&quot; He shakes his head quickly and politely declines.Next, Ryan gives a motivational speech, &quot;Unpacking Your Backpack,&quot; where he admonishes a thin crowd in a non-descript hotel meeting room to consider how uncomplicated their lives would be if they didn&apos;t have responsibility for so many things: knick-knacks, photos, furniture, homes, and relationships. &quot;Imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It&apos;s kinda exhilarating, isn&apos;t it?&quot; The crowd is underwhelmed. Back at the airport, Ryan strides into a frequent flyer lounge flashing his membership card, where he is cheerfully greeted. He calls his office and talks to Ned, an assistant, who tells him that he has been invited to speak at GoalQuest XX in Las Vegas as a motivational speaker. Ryan is excited; GoalQuest is a very high-profile conference. He is transferred to his boss, Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), who asks him to come back to Omaha by the end of the week for big news. In a Dallas Hilton bar, Ryan begins trading frequent traveler observations with an attractive blonde business woman, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). They compare perks cards, and she&apos;s impressed by his American Airline Concierge Key. (&quot;Carbon fiber?&quot; she inquires. &quot;Graphite,&quot; he responds modestly.) She mentions that she flies about 60,000 miles a year, and Ryan politely says, &quot;Not bad.&quot; She challenges him to disclose his mileage number. The challenge turns into verbal foreplay as she teases him on the size of his number. &quot;Is it this big?&quot; (Holds hands a few inches apart.) &quot;this big?&quot; (Holds hands further apart.) He mentions that he has a lifetime mileage goal in mind, but won&apos;t say what it is. Later, they swap stories about the most outrÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© places they have had sex, and she declares that she has done it in an airline lavatory on a regional flight. They end up in bed together, and later compare calendars to see if they will be in the same town sometime soon. She decides to return to her room, and he agrees that that would be the &quot;ladylike thing to do.&quot;The next morning, he goes through what is obviously a routine: his workout in the hotel pool, a shoe shine, and the airport. While waiting for his plane, he receives a call from his sister Kara (Amy Morton), who is discussing the wedding of their sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey). Kara is sending him a cardboard cutout of Julie and her fiancÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© because Julie wants him to take a photo of the cutout in Las Vegas at the Luxor pyramid. He reluctantly agrees.Omaha: Voice-over: &quot;Last year I spent 322 days on the road, which meant I spent 43 miserable days at home.&quot; Ryan enters his small studio apartment, which has less personality than a hotel room: minimal utilitarian furniture, no decorations. His neighbor, a diffident young woman, brings over a package that she has signed for: the cutout that his sister wants him to photograph. He invites his neighbor over, and she awkwardly declines, telling him that she is now seeing someone. Ryan is unconcerned.At a staff meeting, Craig is chortling that the economic downturn has created a wonderful opportunity for their firm, and introduces Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a fresh young up-and-comer who has recently graduated at the top of her class at Cornell. Natalie introduces an on-line monitor that will be used to fire people from a remote location over the internet, eliminating the need for human resource specialists such as Ryan to travel. Ryan is appalled at the impersonality of the process -- and, we suspect, at the loss of his travel privileges. After the meeting, he goes to Craig&apos;s office to protest. Natalie joins them, and Ryan tells her that she knows nothing of the realities of firing a person. She brightly tells him that she majored in psychology, and Ryan challenges her to fire him. She takes on the challenge, and tries to fire him, failing miserably. Later, Craig accuses him of not being a team player and becoming a dinosaur. Craig tells Ryan that Natalie will be accompanying him on the road for the next few days to learn the ropes, much to Ryan&apos;s chagrin.At home, Ryan packs for another road trip -- his shelves are as sparse as his apartment, utilitarian, containing nothing that is not traveling business attire. He is chagrined when he realizes that he has to carry the cut-out, which does not quite fit into his luggage. At the airport, he checks in with his usual efficiency, and then sighs when he sees Natalie arriving with a large, impractical suitcase. He forces her to buy a suitcase that will fit in the overhead compartment, telling her that he flies over 370 days a year, and that not checking luggage saves him the equivalent of a week a year. He ruthlessly pares her packing, tossing things he deems unnecessary into the trash. In the security line, he gives her the benefit of his traveling experience: Never get behind families or old people and try to find an Asian, because Asians travel light, wear slip-on shoes, and therefore move through security faster. Natalie: &quot;That&apos;s racist!&quot; Ryan: &quot;I stereotype -- it&apos;s faster.&quot;St. Louis: Alex calls Ryan as Ryan and Natalie are heading for the car rental. She&apos;s in Atlanta, and they try to match up overlapping time somewhere. They agree to meet at SDF (Louisville). Ryan and Natalie enter another office and begin their job of firing people. Natalie is instructed to stay quiet and simply hand them their benefits package, but she can&apos;t resist piping up with an inanity when a man called Bob (J.K. Simmons) asks what his family is supposed to do when he is on unemployment. Ryan, who has taken the time to read the Bob&apos;s resume, rescues the interview by helping him realize that this is an opportunity for him to follow his dream of being a chef. Bob leaves, resigned but less angry.Ryan bypasses a long line of people to check in at the Hilton Honors desk. An irate customer protests that Ryan just waltzed to the front of the line, but a smiling desk clerk tells her, &quot;We reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members!&quot; Ryan helpfully hands the customer a brochure, and, still irate, she snatches it from him. At dinner with Natalie, Ryan orders several dinners to use up his $40 per diem. Natalie is surprised, and he tells her that he tries not to spend a nickle that doesn&apos;t go towards his frequent flyer miles. She asks why, and he tells her that he is aiming for ten million miles. She scoffs at what she deems to be a meaningless hobby, but he points that that he would be only the seventh person to attain that level, and goes on to describe the award: lifetime executive status, meeting the chief pilot Maynard Finch, and getting his name painted on the side of a plane. Natalie is unimpressed, and declares that if she had those miles, shed show up at the airport, pick a place, and go.That evening, in bed, Ryan looks at his sister&apos;s wedding invitation. He receives text messages from Alex that quickly becomes sexually suggestive. He responds, smiles, and turns out the light.The next morning, Natalie helps Ryan by taking a photo of the cutout in front of the St. Louis airport. She doesn&apos;t understand the significance of the airport, and Ryan explains that &quot;the Wright Brothers flew here!&quot; and goes on to ask Natalie if she never wondered why Charles Lindbergh&apos;s plane was called Spirit of St. Louis. Dismissively, she tells him no, she never wondered.Wichita. Another office. Another firing, but the employee is angry. Afterwards, Ryan tells Natalie that sometimes, they just need to vent. Natalie is taken aback, but wants to try firing the next person, who at first appears to take the news calmly, but then announces in the same calm fashion that &quot;There&apos;s this beautiful bridge by my house. I&apos;m going to go jump off it.&quot; Natalie is distraught, and races from the building. Ryan reassures her that people say all sorts of things while they are being fired, and never mean them.Kansas City. They enter an office that has been decimated -- only a few employees remain, and the receptionist is resigned when she sees them. In the hotel, Ryan overhears Natalie talking to her boyfriend as she declares, &quot;I don&apos;t even think of him that that way -- he&apos;s OLD.&quot; Ryan is taken aback. Alex joins him, and they enter a hotel room.Des Moines. Another office, another firing. Natalie is starting to feel the emotional strain.Miami. Ryan is giving another motivational talk, which he continues with the same allusion to getting rid of human connections, because relationships are the heaviest components of their lives. He declares, &quot;The slower we move, the faster we die . . . we&apos;re sharks, we have to keep moving.&quot; Returning to the hotel, Natalie challenges Ryan about never getting married. He declares he is never getting married, and invites her to try to sell him on the idea of marriage. Hes not buying. As they continue the discussion in the hotel lobby, Ryan wraps up the argument by declaring &quot;Make no mistake, we all die alone.&quot; Natalie suddenly dissolves in great sobbing tears and announces that her boyfriend, Bryan, has left her. As she falls sobbing into Ryan&apos;s arms, he sees Alex descending the stairs. Ryan introduces Alex to Natalie, and over drinks, Alex commiserates with Natalie: &quot;He broke up with you by text? What a prick!&quot; Ryan slyly agrees: &quot;Almost as bad as being fired by internet.&quot; Natalie glares at him. Natalie goes on to tell them that she moved to Omaha to follow Bryan, giving up a good job offer in San Francisco, and goes on to lament that no matter how much success she might have professionally, it won&apos;t matter unless she finds the right guy. She has a mental schedule of deadlines that she had hoped to accomplish, and earnestly declares that she could have made her relationship with Bryan work because he met most of her requirements. Alex and Ryan smile and tell her that deadlines pretty much go out the window after a certain age. Alex goes on to explain that at 34, her expectations for a man have radically changed and describes the kind of man she&apos;d like. Ryan listens with interest. Natalie observes that &quot;that&apos;s depressing. We should just date women.&quot; Alex says, matter-of-factly, &quot;Tried that. Were no picnic ourselves,&quot; she observes, to Ryan&apos;s surprise. Natalie says that she doesn&apos;t want to settle, and Alex tells her that she&apos;s young, so settling seems like failure. Natalie declares, earnestly, that is IS failure, by definition.As they return to their rooms, Natalie asks what the plans for the evening are. Alex and Ryan are taken aback and had obviously not expected to include her in their plans. Ryan announces that they are going to hit the party for the tech conference that is being held in the hotel. Natalie says that she didn&apos;t know they were registered, and Alex and Ryan hem and haw until Natalie realizes that they are planning to crash the party, at which point she enthusiastically declares, &quot;I&apos;m in!&quot; They casually walk up to the registration desk, grab some unclaimed badges and enter the party. Natalie has inadvertently picked up a name tag for Jennifer Chu, but Ryan assures her that no one will notice. Natalie proceeds to quickly down a few drinks and begins to mingle, meeting a man called Dave. (This is a reference to Natalie&apos;s list of preferences in a boyfriend -- one of the odder items was &quot;a one-syllable name like Matt or ... Dave.&quot;) Ryan and Alex dance. MC comes on stage to sing and gets the crowd amped up. Later, Ryan offers Alex his hotel room key, &quot;the key to my place,&quot; and Alex takes it, commenting lightly that she didn&apos;t realize they were at that point in their relationship. On an evening boat ride with other members of the conference, Natalie sings karaoke and Ryan and Alex sit on the back of the boat talking. Alex tells Ryan that she never has a chance to act this way at home, and asks him about his motivational philosophy: &quot;Is the bag empty because you hate people or you hate the baggage that they come with?&quot; He comments that recently, he&apos;s been thinking about emptying the backpack, and what he&apos;d put back in it. He smiles, they kiss and at that moment, the boat loses power. A speedboat rescues them and ferries them to shore, where they have to splash through the surf to the beach. Laughing and drenched, the crowd scurries into the hotel. The next morning, Ryan wakes to see Alex finishing getting dressed -- she has stayed the night. She declares that if she catches a standby, she can make a meeting in Cincinnati. Ryan looks momentarily disappointed, and she chides him playfully, &quot;Oh, I made you feel cheap!&quot; They laugh, and as she leaves, Ryan tells her, &quot;Hey -- I really like you.&quot;At breakfast at a poolside table, Natalie tries to apologize for what she might have said or done the night before, and Ryan tells her that it was good to see her cut loose. He then asks her if she woke him up or slipped out (referring to the man she picked up at the party). Natalie admits that she just slipped out, and Ryan observes that &quot;The protocol&apos;s always tricky.&quot;As they are taking another picture of the cutout against the Miami skyline, Natalie asks Ryan questions about Alex, finally asking, &quot;So, what kind of relationship do you have?&quot; He tells her that it&apos;s casual, and Natalie asks if there&apos;s a future. Ryan tells that he hadn&apos;t thought about it, but Natalie becomes annoyed. Ryan tries to explain: &quot;You know that moment when you look into someone&apos;s eyes and you can feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second?&quot; Natalie nods, &quot;Yes!&quot; Ryan declares, &quot;Yeah, well, I don&apos;t.&quot; Angrily, Natalie throws down the cutout on the dock and declares that he&apos;s an asshole, Alex might be a chance at a real relationship, and then goes on to tell him that his philosophy is bullshit, he has a &quot;cocoon of self-banishment&quot; and that he has set up a way of life that makes it impossible for him to have any kind of human connection. She storms off, and the cutout blows into the water. Ryan tries to reach it, but falls into the water, too. Back in his room, he carefully blow dries the picture, but safely tucked in the suitcase on the way to Detroit, it is a bit worse for wear.In Detroit, Ryan warns Natalie that Detroit is a rough town and that the employees are touchy and will be difficult. When they enter the office, Ryan is surprised to see a computer screen sitting on the table. Craig greets them from the screen -- he has arranged for a trial run of the internet-based firing procedure. They will be at a desk in the next room, but will only talk to the employees via computer screen. Natalie takes the first employee. At first, he is belligerent -- they can hear him bellowing in the next room through the thin walls -- but he later starts to sob disconsolately. Natalie is distressed, but hides it behind some stock encouraging phrases. She sends the employee away, and takes a deep breath. Craig has been monitoring the exchange, and is thoughtful. Ryan tells her, unconvincingly that she did good as she looks forlornly at the list of employees -- this was the first of over fifty employees that will be released.In the parking lot, Natalie leans against the car as Ryan talks to Craig, trying to convince him that they are still needed on the road. After the conversation, he resignedly tells Natalie that Craig has called them off the road: &quot;We&apos;re going home.&quot; At the airport, Ryan stares out the large plate glass window, gazing at an airplane that has a large white area, just waiting for a name to be painted on it. He looks at his sister&apos;s wedding invitation, and realizes that the date is this weekend and he has never returned the RSVP card. As they walk through the airport, Natalie tries to apologize for what she said about Alex, and Ryan ungraciously accepts her apology. Suddenly, he turns and tells Natalie that he will meet her in Omaha, but he&apos;s got to catch another flight.In Las Vegas, Ryan meets Alex and gets the requested photo of the cutout in front of the Luxor pyramid. Ryan invites Alex to his sister&apos;s wedding in northern Wisconsin. Surprised, Alex demurs, but finally agrees, and they fly into Milwaukee. They check in at the local hotel, the Chalet, a pseudo-Tyrolean motel, and stand in line. Seeing a clerk behind the desk, Ryan asks her if she is free, but she condescendingly tells him that &quot;This line is only for members of our Matterhorn program!&quot; As he enters his room with Alex, his sister Kara comes out of her room, and he introduces Alex to Kara. Kara is surprised: &quot;Ryan has told me . . . nothing about you.&quot; She tells him that she is staying at the hotel because she and her husband are having a trial separation, and reminds him of the rehearsal dinner that evening. At dinner, Julie is pleased to see Ryan and meet Alex, proudly showing off a small, diamond chip ring that Jim designed, and introduces her fiancÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© Jim (Danny McBride), who is friendly in an awkward sort of way. Ryan offers her the photos that he has taken, and she asks him to pin them to a map that contains dozens and dozens of photos. Ryan has a hard time fitting his in. They explain that all of Jim&apos;s money is tied up in a real estate investment and made a honeymoon unfeasible financially, so the photos would be the next best thing.After the dinner, Ryan offers to walk Julie down the aisle the next day since their dad isn&apos;t around, but embarrassed, she gently refuses, telling him that Jim&apos;s uncle will be escorting her. Ryan is somewhat hurt, but puts a good face on it and tells her that he just wanted to make sure she was covered. Julie is distressed that she might have hurt his feelings but when he asks when he should be at the church, she tells him, &quot;Well, guests are supposed to be there at 5:00 so, 5:00 would be good,&quot; again relegating him to the status of a mere guest.The next day, Alex and Ryan break into the local school so that Ryan can show her around. He points out his state basketball championship photo in the trophy case. Alex is surprised, and they end up kissing on the make-out stairs behind the gym. They sit down to watch a practice, but his cell phone rings: It&apos;s Kara, who tells him that hes needed at the church.Alex drops him off at the church and returns to the hotel to grab his suit. Julie is distraught because Jim has gotten cold feet. Kara wants him to talk to Jim, but Ryan points out that he might not be the best one, because his job is to tell people how to avoid commitment. &quot;What kind of fucked up message is that?&quot; exclaims Kara. &quot;It could have helped you,&quot; he retorts, referring to her separation, but reluctantly agrees to talk to Jim. He finds him in a Sunday school classroom reading The Velveteen Rabbit. Jim tells him that he began to think about what his life was going to be like: house, children, jobs, losing his hair, and then dying, and wonders what the point is. Ryan observes that a good marriage is something that people aspire to, but Jim points out that Ryan was never married, and that he seems happier than anyone else he knows. Ryan agrees that there&apos;s no point to it all, but points out that the most important moments of his life had other people involved, and observes that life is better with company, with a co-pilot. Jim accepts this, and then asks &quot;What&apos;s it like out there?&quot; Ryan admits that Julie is upset. Jim comes out and apologizes to Julie, asking her &quot;Will you be my co-pilot?&quot; Julie tearfully agrees, and the wedding proceeds. Alex and Ryan hold hands during the vows, and dance intimately at the reception.At the airport, Alex asks when she will see Ryan again and Ryan tells her that she&apos;s going to have to come visit him, since hes been essentially grounded. She moves to her gate and tells him to &quot;call me when you get lonely.&quot; As she walks away, he calls out, &quot;I&apos;m lonely.&quot; She laughs, and keeps walking. In Omaha, back at his apartment, he puts his things away, and looks around, dissatisfied. He opens the refrigerator to reveal an impressive collection of airline miniature booze bottles in the refrigerator door.At the office the next morning, Natalie proudly shows him around the call center that is being beta tested, and comments that the workers are called &quot;termination engineers. I wanted to call them Terminators, but was that bumped by Legal.&quot; &quot;I can&apos;t imagine why,&quot; Ryan responds drily. Ryan sits at a desk and distastefully tries on a headset. He checks the internet for the schedule for GoalQuest XX, and sees when he is scheduled to speak.In Las Vegas, he is mentally preparing for his speech, and as he is introduced to a crowd of several hundred, he takes the podium with his backpack. He begins the spiel that we have heard before but then stops and gazes out over the audience. He looks down at the podium, shakes his head ruefully, excuses himself, and walks out, to the consternation of the event organizers. He dashes through the airport and catches a flight to Chicago, where he arrives in the evening. In a hurry, he steps out of his routine and drives away without giving the car clerk his rewards card. He pulls up in front of Alex&apos;s townhouse and rings the doorbell. Alex comes to the door. She is shocked as he says, smiling, &quot;So, I was in the neighborhood . . .&quot; Suddenly, he hears children arguing and we see them running in the hall behind Alex. Ryan begins to back away, and with a stricken look on Alex&apos;s face, we hear a male voice ask, &quot;Who&apos;s at the door, honey?&quot; She closes the door gently as she responds, &quot;Just someone asking directions.&quot;At the hotel, Ryan sits on a bed in a darkened room with a drink, staring out into the evening. On the train to the airport the next morning, he receives a call from Alex, who demands, &quot;What were you thinking, showing up at my door like that?&quot; He protests that he didn&apos;t know she was married, and she declares that he could have seriously messed up her &quot;real life,&quot; and that she thought he understood. He said that he thought he was part of her real life, and asks her to help him understand. She tells him that he is an escape, an escape from their normal lives, a &quot;parenthesis.&quot; &quot;A parenthesis?&quot; he repeats, dully. Alex is unapologetic. &quot;Well, what did you want? If you want to see me again, give me a call.&quot; He hangs up on her gently.Returning to Omaha, Ryan is gazing out the window when the flight attendant comes on the intercom to excitedly announce that they are flying over Dubuque, which means that a startled Ryan has hit the 10 million miles mark. Champagne is brought for all the first class passengers, and Chief Pilot Maynard Finch (Sam Elliott) greets Ryan. He sits in the seat next to Ryan and congratulates him, telling him that hes the youngest yet to get to 10 million. He pulls out the special silver card, engraved Ryan Bingham, #7 and presents it to Ryan, telling him that they really appreciate Ryan&apos;s loyalty. Ryan is speechless, and tells the Captain that he forgot what he always wanted to say at that movement. The Captain asks him where he&apos;s from, and Ryan, looking down, says softly, &quot;I&apos;m from here.&quot;In his office, Ryan looks at his card, and, making a decision, dials the number on the card. He is greeted with a cheery &quot;Good morning, Mr. Bingham!&quot; Surprised, he asks how they knew it was him, and is told that it&apos;s his dedicated line. He begins to make arrangements to transfer miles to Julie and Jim for an around the world trip, which costs half-a-million miles each.Craig comes into his office and asks him if he remembers a Karen Barnes whom Natalie fired. Ryan says that they have fired dozens of people, and he doesn&apos;t remember. Craig tells him that Karen jumped off a bridge and killed herself, and he needs to know if she gave any indication of her intentions, which could get them into trouble legally. Ryan says he doesn&apos;t remember anything, and asks if Natalie is all right. Craig tells him that Natalie quit by sending him a text message. &quot;Fucking nice, right? Nobody has any manners anymore,&quot; he grouses, and goes on to tell Ryan that he is returning the workforce to the field.San Francisco. Natalie is interviewing for the job she had been offered when she first graduated from Cornell. The interviewer asks her why she went to Omaha, and she reluctantly admits that &quot;I followed a boy.&quot; After a few searching questions, the interviewer shows Natalie a letter of recommendation that he has received from Ryan. The letter is glowing, and the interviewer offers her the job.A montage of interview clips follows. Employees whom we have seen being fired throughout the movie are in some sort of interview/counseling session. Each in their own way, they explain that while losing their job was difficult, it was made easier by the support of their friends and families.Ryan enters an airport, suitcase in tow, and comes to stand in front of a large Departures and Arrivals board, gazing at the number of flights. He releases the suitcase, and he stands alone, in front of the board with no baggage. We hear Ryan&apos;s voice-over: &quot;Tonight, most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids. Their spouses will ask about their day, and tonight they&apos;ll sleep. The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places and one of those lights, slightly brighter than rest, will by my wingtip passing over.&quot; The credits roll over a view of early evening blue clouds as seen below from an airplane, with a faint sunset in the far distance.</Plot>

        <Plot>Valkyrie opens with a Colonel Stauffenberg in Africa,penning in a journal his thoughts about World War II,and how he feels Hitler is destroying Germany. Stauffenberg states he took an oath to swear allegiance to Hitler,but feels he owes more to Germany. He argues with a general about holding a key city in a futile effort against the British Army and American General Patton. The general agrees to have the 10th Panzer moved to a different location where they can be evacuated back to mainland Europe. Shortly thereafter,the camp is attacked and Stauffenberg is badly injured,losing one of his eyes,his right hand,and two fingers from his left hand.The next scene shows Hitler visiting a base camp in Germany,and a nervous General Trescow onlooking. As Hitler prepares to depart,Trescow and an associate hide a bomb in a wine case and give to a man on Hitler&apos;s plane,but it fails to detonate in flight,and Trescow must return to headquarters to retrieve it. Once he arrives,he meets up with who is revealed as a fellow conspirator,a General Olbricht. Trescow safely retrieves the wine case and he and Olbrict discuss a member of their secret committee who was recently arrested. Trescow recommends Olbricht contact Colonel Stauffenberg as a replacement,which Olbricht does,and bring Stauffenberg to one of the clandestine meetings.In the meeting,Stauffenberg meets three of the most important figures in the resistance. A Dr. Goerdeler,who will become Chancellor of Germany should the plot succeed,a General Beck,who will lead the Armed Forces,and a man named Witzleben. After tempers flare,Stauffenberg agrees to help. At a later meeting,Stauffenberg suggests they utilize Operation Valkyrie,which is a plan that uses the Reserve Army to keep order amongst the Germany country should anything disrupt communications from Hitler,or should Hitler be killed. Stauffenberg rewrites the order to exclude the SS from taking control,which would leave the head of the Reserve Army,General Fromm,in charge of Germany. Reaching out to General Fromm,Stauffenberg and Olbricht are surprised at his rejection,but Fromm keeps quiet,choosing to neither support the dissenters nor reports them to the authorities. Meanwhile,General Trescow is sent to the front lines. Stauffenberg is promoted to head of the plan,and he,along with his assistant Lieutenant Haeften,take the order to the Berghof to be signed off by Hitler himself. Hitler,with his inner circle present,praises Stauffenberg&apos;s loss of appendages as the attitude necessary for his military,and states Stauffenberg is the ideal German. He then signs off on the bill,saying he&apos;s sure the changes are adequate.Back at command,a Colonel Quirnheim shows the dissenters how to use pencil detonators,and Stauffenberg persuades a General Fellgiebel,who controls communications at the Wolf&apos;s Lair,to help. Stauffenberg has been promoted to General Fromm&apos;s chief-of-staff,and thus has access to Hitler&apos;s military debriefings,so the plan goes as follows: Stauffenberg and Haeften will travel to Hitler&apos;s bunker,the Wolf&apos;s Lair,to attend a military meeting. Stauffenberg will ignite one of the pencil detonators and then have Fellgiebel call and pretend to be a general,pulling Stauffenberg out of the meeting while Haeften waits with a car. In theory,Stauffenberg and Haeften will have six minutes to drive before the bomb detonates,giving them time to return to the airfield and fly off before they can be suspected. The only condition the heads of the dissenters give,however,is that head of the SS Himmler,along with Hitler,must be present for Stauffenberg to arm the bomb. Stauffenberg travels to the Wolf&apos;s Lair and has all preparations ready,but notices Himmler is not present at the meeting and calls the committee to ask if he may proceed anyways. He is refused by the committee,unbeknownst to Olbricht,who mobilizes the Reserve Army anyways. As Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker,the Reserve Army believes they were just running a training drill,and Olbricht and Stauffenberg are ordered to report to General Fromm,who is outraged they would mobilize the army without his permission. He tells them that if this happens again he will arrest them both.Dr. Goerdeler has a warrant issued for his arrest and General Beck implores him to leave the country. Goerdeler,Stauffenberg&apos;s chief opponent on the committee,hastily leaves and is replaced by Colonel Quirnheim. Colonel Stauffenberg visits his home and tells his wife his plan,and that she and his children must leave,because of their suffering if he should fail. They do so,and Stauffenberg makes his next attempt on Hitler&apos;s life as he attends another military debriefing on July 20,1944. Much to his surprise,the meeting has been moved from Hitler&apos;s bunker to an open window summer hut. The blast would be most effective in the pressurized bunker,where the thick walls would deflect the pressure back to the bomb&apos;s origin,wiping out everyone in the bunker. Stauffenberg plans to proceed anyways but then notices Himmler is once again not present. He calls the committee to ask permission to continue and they say no,but Stauffenberg and Quirnheim privately agree to continue anyways,and Stauffenberg enters the summer hut. He and Haeften arm the bomb in a washroom and place it under the war room table,as Haeften gets the car. Fellgiebel gives Stauffenberg his distraction call,and Stauffenberg hastily leaves the hut.In the war room,an enraged Hitler bangs his fist against the table,knocking Stauffenberg&apos;s briefcase,with armed bomb inside,over. A correspondent at the table sees Stauffenberg&apos;s fallen bag and moves it behind a table leg opposite Hitler. As Stauffenberg walks to his car,the bomb detonates. Fellgiebel phones Quirnheim,but poor reception keeps Quirnheim from fully understanding what all has happened,only hearing that the bomb has indeed detonated. Believing his job to be done,Fellgiebel orders them to shut off all communications. Olbricht impores Quirnheim to phone back and find out if Hitler really is dead,but the broken phone lines keep that from happening. Olbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army until he has received confirmation that Hitler has indeed been killed,and leaves for lunch. Quirnheim issues the mobilization order behind Olbricht&apos;s back,and the Reserve Army,led by Major Remer,mobilize in Berlin. Meanwhile,Stauffenberg,Haeften,and their driver quickly make their way out of the Wolf&apos;s Lair,and Stauffenberg cleverly tricks soldiers into opening checkpoints for him. He makes it back to the airfield,and quickly flies a plane back the government district of Berlin.Much to his shock,the delay caused by Olbricht issuing the order could substantially set the effort back,but they proceed with the plan as scheduled. They march to General Fromm&apos;s office and inform him that Hitler is dead,and that he can either join their cause or be arrested. Fromm calls the Wolf&apos;s Lair,whose communication has been restored,and hears that Hitler is,in fact,alive. Stauffenberg dismisses this and asks Fromm whose side he&apos;s on. Fromm attempts to arrest Stauffenberg and Olbricht,but is himself arrested. Stauffenberg,Olbricht,and Beck,as heads of the Reserve Army under Operation Valkyrie,give orders to arrest all SS officers and seize control of Berlin. Major Remer follows these requests until he reaches the SS headquarters in France. Contradicting orders have been sent,one from the Wolf&apos;s Lair ordering the arrest of Stauffenberg,and one from Stauffenberg ordering the arrest of Minister Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels,shown slipping a cyanide pill in his mouth as he watches the Reserve Army approach,picks up a phone and asks to be connected. Remer walks in and states the man is under arrest,but the man gives Remer the phone. Hitler is on the other line,and he commands Werner to release all SS and capture those in charge alive. Remer cancels the occupation of Berlin and marches to Stauffenberg.Rumors are swirling that Hitler is alive,which Stauffenberg dismisses as SS propaganda. But gradually,Stauffenberg&apos;s associates in headquarters are defecting. The Reserve Army reaches headquarters,and Stauffenberg,Haeften,Quirnheim,Olbricht,and Beck attempt to leave. All are captured,and General Fromm is released from his cell. Wanting to appear innocent,Fromm orders the immediate arrest of the conspirators. In his office,he condemns Stauffenberg,Quirnheim,Olbricht,Haeften,and Beck to death,but allows Beck to kill himself with a pistol.The remaining four are taken outside and executed by firing squad. Meanwhile,General Trescow,hearing of the failure,is shown committing suicide on the front lines with a grenade. Goerdeler is shown executed by hanging,and eventually Stauffenberg is brought before the firing squad. Quirnheim and Olbricht have already been executed,and only Stauffenberg and Haeften remain. Stauffenberg is prepared to face his death when Haeften steps in front of him,taking the firing squad&apos;s first shots,and falling dead. The firing squad reloads,and aims at Stauffenberg,who screams &quot;Long live sacred Germany,&quot; before falling dead. Witzleben is shown publicly denouncing Hitler in a trial,and the film reveals he too was executed. Then the film states that General Fromm&apos;s hasty executions could not save himself,and he too,was executed for not reporting the conspirators. The film concludes with a byline announcing Hitler&apos;s suicide less than a year later,and reveals that Stauffenberg&apos;s wife and children survived.</Plot>

        <Plot>David Aames (Tom Cruise) drives to work,he finds the streets of New York strangely deserted at rush hour. With growing unease he drives to Times Square and finds the entire city abandoned. He then awakens in his bedroom once again to realize he&apos;s only been having a vivid dream.Cut to: David in a jail cell describing a dream to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell),a psychologist who has been assigned to him. David has been charged with a murder he cannot remember,and he wears a mysterious pale mask. He and Dr. McCabe discuss the events that led to his eventual incarceration. Following the death of David&apos;s father,he was given 51% ownership of his father&apos;s publishing company. The rest of the company is owned by a board of directors that David disparagingly calls the &quot;Seven Dwarfs.&quot; Each of them believed that he was next in line to take over the company after David&apos;s father died. David can have anything his heart desires,and nothing is beyond him.On the night of his birthday party which also includes a conversation with a drunken Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall),the company attorney and an old friend of David&apos;s father,David considered firing Thomas for what he believes is his incompetence as an attorney,but he has a change of heart when Thomas makes a sad confession.David&apos;s best friend,Brian Shelby (Jason Lee),brings with him a girl named Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) whom he just met at the library. Almost instantly,David and Sofia flirt with each other,almost completely ignoring Brian. However,Julianna Gianni (Cameron Diaz),a regular bed partner for whom David has no deep feelings,crashes his party. She stays distant but keeps a close eye on him the entire night. Once David realizes Julianna is there,he asks Sofia to pretend to engage in a deep conversation with him so that Julianna won&apos;t come near him. David and Sofia end up hitting it off. David walks Sofia back to her place,where they stay up all night talking.The next morning as David is getting ready to drive to work,Julianna drives up beside him asking how his night with Sofia was. Julianna makes David feel guilty about ignoring her and convinces him to get into her car. It quickly becomes apparent that she is obsessed with David. She starts driving recklessly,speeding through busy city streets,all the while insisting that she&apos;s deeply in love with him and berating him for treating her so casually. Fearing for their safety,he tries to get her to stop the car by telling her that he loves her. She drives the car off a bridge in an attempt to kill them both.Julianna did not survive the crash. David did,however,although his face and right arm are mangled,and he suffers blinding headaches due to the metal pieces holding his skull together. He spends a long time in isolation before deciding to take back control of his company and see Sofia again. She appears hesitant to be around him,and when they go on a date she brings Brian along. The date is a disaster as David drinks too much and makes Sofia increasingly uneasy around him. The three part ways at the end of the night,and David ends up passing out on a sidewalk. It is morning when Sofia wakes him up at that same exact spot and tells him that she will stay with him if he can get his act together. From that moment on,David&apos;s life is turned around. His team of plastic surgeons is able to restore his face and he finds his soul mate in Sofia.David&apos;s new-found happiness is short-lived,however,when he begins hallucinating. He looks in the mirror to see his face once again disfigured. A mysterious man (Noah Taylor) turns up wherever he goes and tells David that he has the power to control the world. And one night he goes to bed with Sofia and wakes up to find himself with Julianna,who insists she really is Sofia. He grows violent,convinced that Julianna is alive and playing games with him. He is arrested and told by Tipp that he severely beat Sofia,but Tipp will have the case thrown out. Tipp shows David photos of Julianna with a bruised face,but everybody,including his best friend Brian,tells him that it was Sofia he attacked.David breaks into Sofia&apos;s apartment and finds that every photo he&apos;d seen of Sofia is now of Julianna. Julianna attacks him thinking he&apos;s an intruder but then apologizes while still insisting she is Sofia. She leaves the room and the actual Sofia returns in her place as if nothing unusual had happened. They begin to make love but while they are in the middle of the act he finds that he is making love to Julianna. In a fit of panic he suffocates her and then discovers he has just killed Sofia.When David is finished telling Dr. McCabe his story he still can&apos;t bring himself to believe that he killed anybody. Dr. McCabe,frustrated by David&apos;s failure to tell him anything meaningful that might help his case,tells him that he can no longer help David and will try to argue for &quot;temporary derangement&quot;. This odd turn of legalistic phrase is just one of many clues that in this version of David&apos;s world all is not what it seems. As Dr. McCabe leaves,David sees an infomercial for a cryonics company called &quot;Life Extension.&quot; This infomercial involving a dog that has been frozen and brought back to life has appeared at several points throughout the film. David is entranced by the commercial,and McCabe sees that there may be a connection between Life Extension and David&apos;s amnesia.Escorted by Dr. McCabe and the police,David visits Life Extension and realizes that he had signed on as a client. He had opted for an extra feature called the Lucid Dream. This allows cryogenically-frozen,clinically dead clients to experience an unending custom-made dream life with no memory of their physical death.David realizes that he is now living in the Lucid Dream and that the mysterious man is his &quot;Technical Support.&quot; The Support Technician explains that the Lucid Dream was &quot;spliced&quot; into his memories at the point where he passed out on the sidewalk after his night out with Sofia and Brian. But the dream went awry and turned into a nightmare. Since nothing he experienced after the splice was real David realizes that he never murdered anybody. Dr. McCabe tells him that the guilt he felt for the way he treated Julianna may have caused his subconscious to merge Julianna and Sofia. But it turns out that Dr. McCabe isn&apos;t real either; he&apos;s just a character David created in his dream to be the father figure he always wanted. Most curious is the fact that Dr. McCabe seems to believe that he himself is real and only reluctantly comes to accept the truth (he had previously mentioned that he was going out with his two daughters for dinner after a session with David,but when The Support Technician asks him &quot;What are their [your daughters&apos;] names,Dr. McCabe has no response). Tech Support tells David that in reality,he never saw Sofia again,and that Thomas Tipp,the attorney that David considered firing in the beginning,had saved the company for David and helped him regain control from the board of directors. But David,suffering constant pain and depression following his disfigurement,committed suicide.In the end,technical support reveals an upgrade to the software which allows David to either be reinserted into the lucid dream with no memory of the nightmare portion or to be awakened in the present time (which is 150 years after he was frozen) and live in the real world with a restored body. David chooses to be awakened in this future present realizing that everyone he ever knew will be long dead and his wealth will be worth far less. After one last lucid-dream rooftop exchange with Sofia in which she vows to &quot;find you again&quot; he leaps off the skyscraper. Multiple memory-images cascade frenetically through his mind as he falls. The final shot is of a brief whiteout (rather than the blackout) accompanied by the sound of a woman&apos;s voice telling him to &quot;open your eyes&quot; and an extreme closeup of a single human eye opening and staring into the camera.</Plot>

        <Plot>In center field of Rangers Ballpark,we see George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) standing with a glove on his hand. He turns around and listens to the cheers greeting him as an unseen announcer introduces him to invisible crowds as the 43rd president of the United States of America.We then cut to a cabinet meeting in early 2002,where W is in a deep discussion about how soon they should respond to the recent terrorist attacks on their country by attacking the Axis of either evil or terror (they can&apos;t decide which it should be),although Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright) is reluctant to go to war with either Iraq or Iran,given that it was a non-affiliated terrorist named Osama Bin Laden who was behind it,although both VP Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) and Condi Rice (Thandie Newton) are quick to remind him that both are terrorist holders. George Tenet (Bruce McGill) supports Colin in his way of thinking as Karl Rove (Toby Jones) and Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) laugh behind their hands at him. Eventually Axis of Terror is decided on and the war gets greenlit. Before the meeting is adjourned,W gets everyone together and has them bow their heads in prayer,although more than a few of them clearly don&apos;t have their heart in it.Thirty-six years earlier,in 1966,we see a much younger W at Yale during pledge week. W and the other fraternity pledges are being endured an alcohol-fuelled hazing the basement of their frat house. One of his fellow pledges is challenged to name as many brothers as he is able to,and he manages to get seven. Another brother challenges someone to beat that,and W steps forward and successfully names all of the frat brothers,stopping only when the lead brother tells him to and getting great cheers for being true Delta Kappa Epsilon material. W tells them that he is pledging the fraternity as a legacy to his father whom was also a plege there,but he states that he has no intrest in persuing his family&apos;s business legacy.We then cut to a jail several months later where W is calling his father,George H.W. Bush (James Cromwell) at home,explaining that there was a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; after a football game in Baltimore that has led to his arrest with several of his frat brothers during a victory party which turned into a riot. George bails his son out and tells him that this is the last time he helps his son out.A few years later,following graduation from Yale,we see Bush working on one of his family oil rigs back in Texas. He takes a break for water and when the foreman yells at him to get back to work,he quits instead. Later on,we see him in a bar with his girlfriend Susie (Marley Shelton) and he gives her a somewhat long-winded proposal and gets up on the bar to dance with her.A few years later,though,he is once again coming before his father. This time,W. is asking George to bail him out of the marriage-that-never-got-official. George agrees to it,but then expresses his disappointment with W.,especially regarding the fact that he only got Cs at Yale and can&apos;t seem to hold a job for more than six months. For his part,W. ignores the criticism and just walks out. (It is implied,but never fully revealed,that George W. Bush is dislexic which would explain his poor grades,with that combined with his growing alcoholism brought during his fraternity hazing at Yale).Present Day,2002. Cheney and W are sitting down to lunch in the oval office. After a little preamble regarding the upcoming war,Cheney takes out a small folder. He explains that inside are some ideas regarding possible interrogation techniques that could be instituted at places such as Guantanamo. W. balks at first,worried that there would be stuff like pulling out toenails,but Cheney assures him that it would be nothing lethal,using examples such as sleep deprivation and water torture to make his point. W is reassured and promises to look at the three-page report. As lunch ends,W then asks Cheney to kindly keep his ego in check,since he&apos;s only the vice-president,and an insulted-looking Cheney nods and walks out. A few days later,at the Bush ranch,W. is having a walk and talk with some members of his cabinet (Rummy,Dick,Condi,a couple others) and General Thomas Franks (Michael Gaston) regarding a start date for the war,which Franks suggests as April/May/June of 2003. Some time later,we see W. watching a college football game and eating pretzels with his dog when he suddenly begins choking. He staggers around the office and comes behind a recliner. He starts pounding himself on the chest with it and is eventually successful in dislodging the pretzel from his throat just as he collapses to the floor,unconscious.In 1972,we see W. and his younger brother Jeb (Jason Ritter) driving up to the Bush home in the middle of the night and both of them &quot;drunk as a skunk&quot;. They stagger into the house where George and Barbara (Ellen Burstyn) start yelling at W. about coming home so drunk in the middle of the night. W. starts posturing as though he wants to fight George when Jeb intervenes saying that George was out celebrating his acceptance into Harvard Business School. This changes the attitude of Barb and George,but W. then admits he&apos;s not going -- he just wanted to see if he could get in. This admission prompts George to admit that he only got in because George had pulled some strings with the admissions board.Five years later. George W. Bush is playing poker with some friends at Harvard and announcing to them that he plans to run for Congress. At a celebratory barbeque cookout,he meets a beautiful young woman named Laura Welch (Elizabeth Banks). Over drinks and cigarettes,Laura reminds him that they went to junior high together and the two slowly warm to each other,with her telling him that she&apos;s a teacher and always tries to see all sides of an argument,making W. want to appoint her his education adviser.Some time later,we see him in a debate against Kent Vance (Paul Rae),whose strategy seems to be pointing out that Bush is not a real Texan,having been born in Connecticut (HEY! *seethes*) and gone to college in Connecticut. Despite W.&apos;s assertions to a softly understanding Laura that this is nothing but tarring and feathering,he still manages to lose the election,albeit by a mere 6,000 votes.Back in 2002,we see Bush standing in the field again,listening to the cheers. Back in reality,we see another cabinet meeting where he and his advisors are discussing the need for a regime change in Iraq.In 1986,W. and Laura are at a 40th birthday party for W where the junior Bush is drinking up a storm with bottle after bottle of wine and hard liquor. During the party,he gets a call from his father George,who wants W. to help with his campaigning for president,which causes W. to announce that he and Laura are moving to Washington when he returns to the restaurant table. Not long after,W. is heading out for a morning run. At one point,he stops due to chest pains and collapses on the side of the road with a heart murmur.Three months later,we see him in an alcoholics anonymous meeting being headed by Rev. Earle Hudd (Stacy Keach Jr). After the meeting has been ended,W. hangs around and prays with Hudd,saying that most of the time he feels this great weight on his shoulders.In 1988,at the convention HQ,George is having a meeting with his advisers,which includes Karl Rove,when W. enters. The meeting is ended and W. shows his father a videotape by the Bush camp smearing Dukakis,citing his decision to give weekend visits to convicted criminals (Willie Horton). This is enough to dissuade voters,who make George Bush Sr. the 41st President of the United States. Despite the celebration,though,W. himself isn&apos;t pleased. Late that night,he confesses to Laura that he almost wanted his father to lose the election,since he constantly feels as though he&apos;s living in George&apos;s shadow and has to live up to him.In 2002,Bush and co. are in a war room,and the current topic of discussion is the location of any possible Weapons of Mass Destruction. Rumsfeld makes the argument that they are most likely in either Tikrit or Baghdad. Cheney agrees and points out that if they don&apos;t act they will lose the advantage they have now,although,as Powell points out,they have no exit strategy and no real American presence. However,after a video call to General Franks,they get confirmation that they expect to have over three hundred thousand troops in Iraq,and that that should speed things up nicely.In 1990,W. is having a conversation with his father over whether or not having faith in God would be of help to him in winning the war in the Persian Gulf. One year later,we see George in the war room with his cabinet celebrating their imminent victory in the Gulf. When asked by Powell if he feels they should have pushed,George decisively says that they went far enough and now need to concentrate on winning the next election. Unfortunately,winning the war wasn&apos;t enough and the presidency is given over to Bill Clinton during the results of the 1992 presidential elections. George is devastated and W. is angry that Clinton was elected despite his past and of his reputation of being a womanizer.Another year or so later,Bush Jr. decides to run for Governor of Texas,despite his parents George Sr. and Barbara begging him to wait,since Jeb is running for Governor of Florida and they can&apos;t be in both states at once,but he refuses to listen. Later on,we see W out campaigning for governorship with Rove&apos;s advice,which in brief is to get across that he is who he is and no other Bush (at one point in here,we see him asking the famous,&quot;Is our children learning?&quot; question). Regardless,he gets elected governor and as a congratulations prize is given a pair of cufflinks by George and a note saying how proud he is. However,this is not enough for W.,who is instead offended that George still can&apos;t tell him he&apos;s proud face-to-face.Five years later in 1999,we see W. in his office when he gets a visit from Earle Hudd. He tells Hudd that he feels he has gotten the call,and then explains that he is talking about the call to be president. Hudd is ecstatic for him,and W. says that he thinks that there will be a bad time for the country,and that God wants him as president in order to help the American people through it. Hudd nods in complete belief,and the two get down on their knees to pray for W.&apos;s delivery to the office of the president.Four years later,in 2003,we see W. giving the state of the union as those who wrote it congratulate each other at various points. Back in the cabinet,W. is determined not to jeopardize their chances in Iraq,despite the massive amounts of protest the war is getting. In a meeting with the British prime minister Tony Blair (Ioan Gruffudd),W. tries to barter for some help from Britain,although Tony is reluctant to commit his own country&apos;s troops. Regardless,W. is determined to win in Iraq,even as his parents grow more and more worried about how things are going for him.A few months later though,things turn dark for Bush and the rest of his cabinet when they find out that Saddam had lied about having Weapons of Mass Destruction,which makes them all look bad. In truth,the caves that were to have the WMDs were lines of cattle showing up on their scans,an error which forces David Kay to resign from his office. Regardless,W. still holds steady,staying committed and visiting wounded soldiers in hospitals. One young Mexican soldier says that he&apos;s sorry he can&apos;t fight for him,and W. tells him to not worry,that now they&apos;re all fighting for him.One night,he and Laura are heading to sleep,and W. reflects on what he has done and realizes that the only thing he can still do is fight to keep his place. Later,we see him enter the oval office when he finds George Sr. there waiting for him. George says that he&apos;s really in deep,even after he pulled W&apos;s ass out of that jam in Florida,and he starts posturing as though wanting to fight W (note -- in this scene more than any other,Brolin is the spitting image of W.). W. starts yelling at George to go away and leave him alone when he suddenly wakes up screaming,realizing that it was just a nightmare.Some time later,we see W. at a press conference where he is continuing to hold support for the war,but the looks on the reporters faces indicate that they&apos;re not buying it anymore. One reporter asks what W. feels his place in history will be,and W. says,&quot;In history? Well,in history we&apos;ll all be dead.&quot; Another reporter asks W. if he feels he may have made any mistakes in his presidency,and W. stammers that he&apos;s been kind of caught off-guard here. Eventually,the press-conference ends and W. storms off into the residential area of the white house,going to his bedroom. When he opens the door,W. is standing in the middle of Ranger&apos;s stadium on a cool autumn night. The invisible crowd is cheering,and the ball is hit towards W. He raises his hand to catch it,and....George W. Bush looks around. The whole stadium is silent. There are no players,no announcers,no crowds,and no baseball. He searches the empty field around him,and he sees that the ball is nowhere nearby. Slightly panicked,W. looks around the field some more,trying to find the ball he lost so he can keep on playing....</Plot>

        <Plot>A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then,the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and,although the unit kills many Vietminh,it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer,Nguyen Huu An,hypothesising that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops,orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later,Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson),a dedicated U.S. soldier,is deeply committed to training his troops,who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure,the unit&apos;s officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought &quot;on the cheap,&quot; without declaring it a national emergency. As a result,Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest,best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam,Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:&quot;Look around you,in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine,another from Puerto Rico,we got Japanese,Chinese,Blacks,Hispanics,Cherokee Indian,Jews and Gentiles,all American. Now here in the States some men in this unit may experience discrimination because of race or creed,but for you and me now,all that is gone. We&apos;re moving into the valley of the shadow of death,where you will watch the back of the man next to you,as he will watch yours,and you won&apos;t care what color he is or by what name he calls God. Let us understand the situation we&apos;re goin into battle against a tough and determined enemy. I can&apos;t promise you that I will bring you all home alive,but this I swear: When we go into battle,I will be the first one to set foot on the field,and I will be the last to step off. And I will leave no one behind. Dead,or alive,we all come home together. So help me God.&quot;After arriving in Vietnam in November 1965,he learns that an American base has been attacked,and is ordered to take his 395 men after the enemy and eliminate them,despite the fact that intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. He leads a newly created air cavalry unit into the Ia Drang Valley against over 4,000 well equipped enemy soldiers.An emotional toll is taken back home,where Moore&apos;s wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and another soldier&apos;s wife take over the job of delivering telegrams that inform families (mainly wives like themselves) living at Fort Benning,Georgia,the unit&apos;s base of operation,of soldiers&apos; deaths.After landing in the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;,the soldiers capture a Vietnamese lookout who informs them that the location they were sent to is actually the headquarters of an entire North Vietnamese division. Another American squad is isolated at some distance from the battalion&apos;s main position,after 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick saw a scout,and rashly ran after him,ordering his reluctant soldiers to follow. The scout leads them into an ambush,resulting in the majority of the platoon members&apos; deaths,including Herrick&apos;s. Sgt. Savage assumes command of the squad,and by calling in artillery and using the cover of darkness,holds off the North Vietnamese from their position. The story switches between the Vietnamese and American points of view several times. Despite being trapped near the landing zone,and desperately outnumbered,the main force manages to hold off the enemy North Vietnamese with artillery,close air support,and even calling a last resort &apos;Broken Arrow&apos; airstrike at their most desperate point,killing some of their own soldiers but eliminating most of the Vietnamese offensive force.The American troopers regroup,secure the area and charge up the mountain where the Vietnamese division headquarters is located. The Vietnamese have set up heavy gun emplacements near the hidden entrance of the underground headquarters spoken of by the scout. Hal and his men charge right at them,into a seemingly impending massacre,but before the Vietnamese can fire,Major Bruce &quot;Snakeshit&quot; Crandall flies in with his helicopter and kills the Vietnamese guards with his side mounted machine guns. Meanwhile,the Vietnamese commander is alerted that the Americans have broken through the lines,and the headquarters has no troops between them and the Americans. He orders the headquarters evacuated. The stranded platoon led by Savage are rescued. Moore,having completed his objective,returns to the L.Z. to be picked up,and,after all of his men,dead or alive,are removed from the battlefield,steps on to a helicopter and flies out of the valley. Strong visual emphasis is placed on Moore&apos;s being the last American to set foot off the field of battle. At the end of the movie it is revealed that Hal Moore returned home safely after 235 more days of fighting.</Plot>

They are divorce mediators with a recreational hobby of crashing weddings to pickup chicks. They&apos;ve been given a secret set of wedding crashing rules by Chaz (Will Ferrell) the guru of wedding crashing. John and Jeremy crash any and all weddings and pretend to be brothers working as venture capitalists or some other line of work.

Eventually,each wins the chosen woman&apos;s heart,and then it&apos;s on to the next wedding! They never stay in the background,but actually get in all the action and pictures of the cutting of the cake,the carrying of the wedding couple,and dancing with the bride. They become a hit at each reception. The daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) is getting married,and it will be the social event of the year. After crashing the wedding,John and Jeremy set their target on the two Cleary sisters,Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher).

        <Plot>Poor Charlie Bucket lives in poverty with his mother and four grandparents. On his way home from school one day,his paper route takes him past the gate of the town&apos;s mysterious,but highly-prized candy-maker,Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder). As Charlie peers through the gates,a man walks by,telling Charlie that &apos;nobody ever goes in,and nobody ever comes out.&apos;Later that night,Charlie discusses this with his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). Joe explains that the man Charlie saw was right. Many years before,other candymakers were sending spies into his factory to steal Wonka&apos;s amazing candy secrets. Finally,Mr Wonka locked the gates,and banished all his workers from the factory. Shortly after this,the factory started up,but noone knows who is making Wonka&apos;s candies now.The next day at school,word spreads quickly that a contest has been launched,with 5 golden tickets hidden in 5 ordinary Wonka bars. The big prize is that those who find these tickets,will get to visit Mr Wonka&apos;s long-isolated factory,and receive a lifetime supply of chocolate. The world then goes crazy,with Wonka candies being sold out at almost every store.The first ticket is found by a gluttonous German boy,named Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner).The second ticket is found by a spoiled little girl named Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole),whose father utilized his peanut factory workers to open Wonka bars from dawn until dusk.The third ticket is found by a girl named Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson),who is an avid gum chewer,having chewed a piece of gum for 3 months straight to achieve a world record.The fourth ticket is found by a boy named Mike TeeVee (Paris Themmen),who is obsessed with television,particularly programs regarding cowboys.*******For many years,a mysterious candy-maker,Mr. Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder),produced amazing treats from his factory in town. But the factory closed without notice a few years ago,then magically began making candy again. But without any employees or workers leaving or entering the factory.Mr. Wonka decides to break his silence and launches a world-wide contest. Five golden tickets are hidden in his candy bars. The lucky finders will win an amazing tour of his candy making factory and a life-time supply of chocolate.Four tickets are quickly won by various children around the world. Charlie finds a coin in the street and decides to buy two bars of candy. And of course,in the second bar is the last golden ticket.He persuades his grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) to climb out of bed for the first time in years and join him on the tour.Charlie meets the other four children and parents and begins an amazing adventure through the magical chocolate factory.One by one,the children become disqualified for displaying terrible qualities - gluttony,greed,stubborness and rudeness. Charlie breaks the rules too by stealing fizzie lifting drink. It makes him and Grandpa Joe float to the ceiling,which has to be washed and sterilized because of their improper activity.Mr. Wonka erupts in a rage when Charlie asks for his prize of chocolate and orders him to leave the factory. Displaying humility and grace,Charlie gives back a sample of a prototype candy (Everlasting Gobstoppers),which becomes the key that opens the door to the factory. Because of that selfless act,Mr. Wonka reveals that Charlie has won the factory and must take over making candy. He invites his whole family to move into the facility and live happily ever after.</Plot>

        <Plot>The film starts on July 4,1969,with the Zodiac killers second attack,the shooting of Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau at a lovers&apos; lane in Vallejo. Mageau survives while Ferrin dies from her injuries. One month later,a letter written by the Zodiac arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Robert Downey,Jr.) is a Chronicle crime reporter. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a political cartoonist there. The newspaper receives encrypted letters that the killer sends,taunting the police. Because of Graysmith&apos;s status as a cartoonist,he is not taken seriously by Avery and the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings despite his interest in the case. In particular,he is drawn to the encrypted code that is included with the letters and is given access to one. When he is able to crack one of the codes and makes several correct guesses about the killer&apos;s actions,Avery begins sharing information with him.The Zodiac killer attacks again,stabbing Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard (Pell James) at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. Shepard dies as a result of the attack,while Hartnell survives. Soon afterward,San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city&apos;s Presidio Heights district. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are assigned to the case,liaising with other detectives such as Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. The killer,or someone posing as him,continues to toy with authorities by speaking on the phone with celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) when he makes an appearance on a television talk show. Avery and Graysmith form an alliance,delving deeper into the case.In 1971,Toschi,Armstrong and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch),a potential suspect in the case. However,a handwriting expert (Philip Baker Hall) insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters. Avery receives a new letter threatening his life. He becomes increasingly paranoid and turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point,he shares information with a rival police force which angers Toschi and Armstrong.By 1975,Avery leaves the Chronicle. Armstrong quits the homicide division,and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith,meanwhile,continues his own in-depth investigation,interviewing witnesses and police detectives involved in the case. Obsessing over the unsolved case,he begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing (on the night of Ferrin&apos;s death,Graysmith discovered that someone prank-called the victim&apos;s family and did the same thing). Due to his submersion in the case,Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) leaves him,taking their children with her.Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the information he discovered over the years,he provides contacts of other police departments in counties where the other murders occurred. The cartoonist acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac,and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt,the hard evidence,such as fingerprints and handwriting samples,exonerate him. In December 1983,a full 14 years after the original slayings,Graysmith tracks down Allen to a Vallejo hardware store,where he is employed as a salesclerk. Eight years later,in 1991,Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot.Final title cards,however,inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be further questioned by police,and that DNA tests performed in 2002 did not match samples gathered from the Zodiac letters.</Plot>
