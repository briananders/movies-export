#Movies Export

I use an app to keep track of all the movies that I own. This app exports xml files for its backups. I am using this repo as an offsite backup as well and a way to see the diff and merge between my iPhone's and iPad's movies app.

###iPhone

backup folder with export.xml

###iPad

export folder with export.xml
